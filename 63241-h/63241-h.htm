<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Medical Jurisprudence</span><a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a> may be defined, a
science by which medicine, and its collateral branches,
are made subservient to the construction, elucidation,
and administration of the laws; and to the preservation
of the public health.</p>

<p class='c000'>It accordingly resolves itself into two great divisions—into
<em>Forensic Medicine</em>, comprehending the
evidence and opinions necessary to be delivered in
courts of justice; and into <em>Medical Police</em>, embracing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ii_b'>ii_b</span>the consideration of the policy and efficiency of legal
enactments for the purpose of preserving the general
health, and physical welfare of the community.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under no circumstances does medical science assume
so imposing and dignified an attitude, as when
regarded as a branch of legislation. Disentangled
from the web with which worldly caprice, credulity,
and empiricism, are ever seeking to embarrass the
more ordinary path of her labours, she at once displays
her pride and strength in the number and variety
of her resources, and in the extent and importance
of their applications; while the professor of our
art is thus enabled to support additional claims upon
the respect of the learned, the confidence of the oppressed,
and the gratitude of the public. In the
active exercise of his duties as a medical jurist, how
exalted and honourable is the occupation of the physician!—there
is scarcely a circle of natural science,
upon the boundaries of which he does not impinge in
some point or other, of his extensive orbit. Trace his
progress, for instance, through the subject of poisons,
and we shall soon perceive that it involves within its
range the departments of anatomy, physiology, botany,
mineralogy, zoology, and chemistry. If, again,
we follow his steps through the deviating and perplexing
course of homicide, in how many new and
interesting forms will the principles of physiology
present themselves; how frequently shall we find
ourselves engaged in the solution of problems connected
with the knowledge of pneumatics, hydrostatics,
and mechanics? If we attend him in the investigation
of nuisances, as affecting the health and
comfort of the surrounding inhabitants, we shall
perceive that an acquaintance with the various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iii_b'>iii_b</span>branches of natural philosophy, can alone enable him
to appreciate the nature and extent of the evil, or the
value of the different plans that may be proposed for
its removal. While the intricate and perplexing subjects
of quarantine and plague police, will require
for their elucidation, the energies of a peculiarly constructed
and well disciplined mind, to concentrate
the genuine lights into a focus, and to dissipate the
many specious, but false appearances, with which the
question of contagion has been distorted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The institution of medicine and jurisprudence,
necessarily arose as the consequence of the physical
and moral infirmities of our nature, and must, therefore,
have been nearly coeval with the origin of society.
In the earlier periods, however, of the world,
the connection between these sciences could only
have been slight, and scarcely, perhaps, perceptible;
although we are strongly inclined to believe that
<em>Medical Jurisprudence</em> has an origin far more ancient,
and an influence far more extensive, than modern
writers have been willing to concede; an opinion
which we are prepared to support by the authorities
of profane as well as sacred writers, and by the
history of civilized as well as barbarous communities.
It must be admitted, that no inconsiderable a part of
the institutions of the great law-giver of Israel, was
a wise system of medical police, well adapted for the
preservation of the health, and the amelioration of
those evils to which the inhabitants of a tropical climate
must have been exposed; and we read, that
Moses was skilled in all the learning of the Egyptians.
In Leviticus,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a> commands are given to
the priests to visit the houses infected with the
plague of leprosy, or with any contagious disease; to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv_b'>iv_b</span>examine the inhabitants; to establish quarantine;
to scrape and white-wash the houses; to shut them
up, and, in bad cases, to pull them down. If we descend
into later times, we shall discover the same
policy of associating the institutions of medical police
with religious ceremonials; by which the performance
of duties, essential to the preservation of the
health, was more effectually enforced. The author
has observed, in the historical introduction of his
“<cite>Pharmacologia</cite>,” that bathing, which at one period
of the world was essentially necessary to prevent the
diffusion of leprosy, and other infectious diseases, was
wisely converted into an act of religion, and the
priests persuaded the people that they could only
obtain absolution by washing away their sins by frequent
ablution;<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a> but, since the use of linen shirts
has become general, and every one has provided for
the cleanliness of his own person, the frequent bath
ceases to be so essential; and, therefore, no evil has
arisen from the change of religious belief respecting
its connection with the welfare and purity of the soul.
Among the religious impurities, and rules of purification
of the Hindus, we shall be able to discern the
same principle, although distorted by superstition.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
So, again, it is easy to perceive, that the dangers
consequent upon vinous inebriation in a hot climate,
suggested the Mahometan prohibition of wine. The
religious ceremonial observed by the ancients, whenever
they proposed to build a town, or to pitch a
camp, was evidently an act of legislation, founded on
a just principle of physiology; they offered a sacrifice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v_b'>v_b</span>to the gods, when the Soothsayer declared, <em>from the
appearance of the entrails</em>, whether they were propitious
or not to the design. What was such an inspection
but a philosophical inquiry into the salubrity
of the district, and the purity of the waters by which
it was supplied?—for it is well known that in unwholesome
situations, especially if swampy, the
viscera of the cattle will universally present an appearance
of disease, which an eye experienced in such
dissections, would easily distinguish.</p>

<p class='c000'>But, in order to shew the universality, as well as
the antiquity, of the policy which we are endeavouring
to establish, we propose to furnish the reader
with an illustration, afforded by the superstitions of
an uncivilized race of modern times. The pearl-diver
in the East-Indian fisheries is constantly exposed,
during his dangerous occupation, to the attack
of the <em>Ground-Shark</em>, a common and terrible inhabitant
of all the seas in those latitudes. In order to
avoid falling in with this foe, the adventurous Indian
seeks for safety in supernatural means. Before he
begins diving, the priest, or conjurer, or, as he is
termed in the Malabar language, the <i>Pillal Karras</i>,
or <i>Binder of Sharks</i>, is always consulted, whose directions
upon these occasions are received with confidence,
and followed with the most implicit obedience.
The advice which is given them, under the
imposing weight of a religious <a id='ord'></a>ordinance, has, for
its sole object, the maintenance of the health of the
diver, and the adaptation of his body for the arduous
occupation in which he is engaged; and it is not a
little curious to observe that in the performance of
this duty, the <i>Pillal Karras</i> appears to display a
judgment, which the most enlightened views of
modern physiology could not improve. The diver,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi_b'>vi_b</span>for instance, is enjoined to abstain from all food for
some time previous to his descent; a practice, the
value of which will be duly appreciated by those who
read our chapter on the physiology of Suffocation,
vol. ii. p. 34.</p>

<p class='c000'>In those countries, where it becomes necessary to
check the increase of population, we again find that
ecclesiastical institutes are made subservient to state
policy; thus the religion of the Island of Formosa<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
prohibits women becoming mothers before the age of
thirty-five years; and, should they become pregnant
before that time, the priestess procures abortion by
violence<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c011'><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the book of sacred law of the Hindus,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a> the
rules for the choice of a wife are formally and minutely
detailed, and will be found remarkably conformable
with our physiological notions respecting the transmission
of disease and deformity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The knowledge of <em>Forensic Medicine</em>, if not as ancient
and universal as the Institutes of Medical Police,
may still boast of an early origin, and a very extensive
influence; thus in <cite>Deuteronomy</cite><a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a> in cases of
doubtful virginity, the Elders are to be consulted, in
order that they may deliver their judgment from the
physiological evidence of the case. In ancient nations
the assistance of the philosopher and physician
was universally required for the prevention, as well as
detection of crime; thus was <i>Archimedes</i> consulted by
the king of Sicily, when a workman was suspected to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii_b'>vii_b</span>have fraudulently alloyed the gold in his crown. The
Romans, especially in the reign of <i>Severus</i>, <i>Antonine</i>,
<i>Adrian</i>, and <i>Aurelius</i>, constructed several laws, and
reformed some others, in conformity with the sentiments
inculcated in the works of <i>Hippocrates</i> and
<i>Aristotle</i>; the capital crime of procuring abortion
was accordingly limited to those cases wherein the
fœtus exceeded forty days; and the <i>Emperor Adrian</i>
passed a decree upon the subject of legitimacy, as
connected with the period of utero-gestation, according
to the physiological opinions with respect to the
possibility of retarded delivery;<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a> while <i>Numa
Pompilius</i> prohibited the burial of a pregnant woman,
or of one supposed to be pregnant, until the fœtus
should have been extracted, or the state of the uterus
ascertained by dissection.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trials by ordeal in the dark ages of modern
Europe, when the decision of the most important
questions was abandoned to chance or to fraud, when
carrying in the hand a piece of red hot iron, or
plunging the arm in boiling water,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c011'><sup>[11]</sup></a> was deemed a
test of innocence, and a painful or fraudulent experiment,
supplanting a righteous award, might consign
to punishment the most innocent, or save from it the
most criminal of men, have ever been deemed a shocking
singularity in the institutions of our barbarous
ancestors. We are ready to admit the justice of this
charge generally; and yet we fancy that, upon some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii_b'>viii_b</span>occasions we are enabled to discern through the dim
mist of credulity and ignorance, a ray of policy that
may have been derived from the dawning of a rude
philosophy. Trials by ordeal, as we are informed by
Mr. <i>Mill</i>, hold a high rank in the institutes of the
Hindus. It appears that there are no less than nine
different modes of trial, but that <em>by water in which an
idol has been washed</em>, and the one <em>by rice</em>, are those
which we shall select as well calculated to illustrate
the observations which we shall venture to offer.
The first of these trials consists in obliging the accused
person to drink three draughts of the water in
which the images of the Sun and other deities have
been washed; and if within fourteen days he has any
indisposition, his crime is considered as proved. In
the other species of ordeal alluded to, the persons
suspected of theft are each made to chew a quantity
of dried rice, and to throw it upon some leaves or
bark of a tree; they, from whose mouth it comes dry,
or stained with blood, are deemed guilty, while those
who are capable of returning it in a pulpy form,
are at once pronounced innocent. When we reflect
upon the superstitious state of these people, and at
the same time, consider the influence which the mind,
under such circumstances, is capable of producing
upon the functions of the body, it is impossible not
to admit that the ordeals above described are capable
of assisting the ends of justice, and of leading to the
detection of guilt. The accused, conscious of his own
innocence, will fear no ill effects from the magical
potation, but will cheerfully acquiesce in the ordeal;
whereas the guilty person, from the mere uneasiness
and dread of his own mind, will, if narrowly watched,
most probably discover some symptoms of bodily indisposition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix_b'>ix_b</span>before the expiration of the period of his
probation. In the case of the ordeal by <em>rice</em>, a result,
in correspondence with the justice of the case,
may be fairly anticipated on the soundest principle
of physiology. There is perhaps no secretion that is
more immediately influenced by the passions than
that of saliva. The sight of a delicious repast to a
hungry man is not more effectual in exciting the salivary
secretion, than is the operation of fear and
anxiety in repressing and suspending it. If the reader
be a medical practitioner, we refer him for an illustration
to the feelings which he experienced during
his examination before the medical colleges; and if he
be a barrister, he may remember with what a parched
lip he gave utterance to his first address to the jury.
Is it then unreasonable to believe that a person
under the influence of conscious guilt, will be unable,
from the dryness of his mouth, to surrender the rice
in that soft state, which an innocent individual, with
an undiminished supply of saliva, will so easily accomplish?</p>

<p class='c000'>These few examples will suffice to shew that Medical
Jurisprudence had an early origin; and yet we
are ready to admit that its applications were extremely
desultory, and often, from the infant state of the sciences
upon which it rested, not only imperfect but
erroneous; indeed the question may be very fairly
maintained, whether on many occasions the evidence
of the physician has not embarrassed where it should
have enlightened, and misled where it was called
upon to direct the steps of justice. Forensic medicine,
however, could scarcely be considered as constituting
a branch of legislation, until its utility was
publicly recognised, and its assistance legally required.
This admission will compel us to assign to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x_b'>x_b</span>Germany the honour of its origin, for the Medical
jurist is first acknowledged, and his services formally
required, in the celebrated criminal code framed by
<i>Charles</i> the Fifth, at the Diet of Ratisbon, in the
year 1532, known by the name of the “<cite>Constitutio
Criminalis Carolina</cite>,” and which still constitutes the
basis of the criminal proceedings of the German
courts. In the code it is enacted, that medical
men shall be consulted whenever death has been occasioned
by violent means, whether criminal or accidental,
by wounds, poisons, hanging, drowning, or
the like; as well as in cases of concealed pregnancy,
procured abortion, child-murder, &amp;c. The publication
of such a code very naturally awakened the attention
of the medical profession, and summoned
numerous writers from its ranks. The first of whom
were <i>Bohn</i><a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c011'><sup>[12]</sup></a>, <i>Valentini</i><a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c011'><sup>[13]</sup></a>, <i>Boerner</i><a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c011'><sup>[14]</sup></a>, <i>Kannegeiser</i><a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c011'><sup>[15]</sup></a>,
and <i>Struppe</i>; <i>Alberti</i><a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c011'><sup>[16]</sup></a>, <i>Zittman</i><a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c011'><sup>[17]</sup></a>,
<i>Richter</i><a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c011'><sup>[18]</sup></a>, <i>Teichmeyer</i><a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c011'><sup>[19]</sup></a>, and <i>Stark</i><a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c011'><sup>[20]</sup></a>; some
years after whom came <i>Hebenstreit</i><a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c011'><sup>[21]</sup></a>, <i>Ludwig</i><a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c011'><sup>[22]</sup></a>,
and <i>Fazellius</i><a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c011'><sup>[23]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first German work of any authority is that of
<i>John Bohn</i>, published in 1689, and entitled “<cite>De
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi_b'>xi_b</span>Renunciatione Vulnerum</cite>,” in which the author attempts
to shew what wounds are necessarily fatal.
In 1704, the same Professor presented to the profession
a forensic work of greater range, for the purpose
of giving rules for the conduct of physicians in attending
the sick, and in delivering evidence before a
court of judicature; it is entitled “<cite>De Officio Medici,
duplici, clinico et forensi</cite>.” At about, or rather previous
to the publication of this latter work, the celebrated
Pandects of <i>Valentini</i> appeared, which form a
compendious retrospect of the opinions and decisions
of preceding writers on Juridical Medicine. In his
preface <i>Valentini</i> endeavours to enforce the necessity
of cultivating this branch of Medical Science; and
although more than a hundred and twenty years have
elapsed, how aptly will his rebuke apply to the medical
witnesses of the present age—“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Evenit sæpe
ut etiam illi qui magno Archiatrorum Practicorumque
felicissimorum titulo superbiunt, in publicis hujuscemodi
occasionibus facultatibus, ut Mus in pice, hæreant,
ineptisque relationibus facultatibus Academicis non
tantum risum moveant, sed et omnem, qua prius gaudebant
estimationem protinus amittant.</span></i>” This was followed
by the works of <i>Kannegeiser</i>, and of <i>Frederic Boerner</i>,
medical professor of Wirtemburg, on various
subjects connected with Legal Medicine. The system
of <i>Alberti</i> of Halle, in six volumes quarto, appeared
in 1725. Amongst the numerous questions
elucidated by this laborious author, we may particularize
those relating to conception and utero-gestation;
and the reader will perceive that we have frequently
availed ourselves of his opinion upon these
points. Nearly cotemporary with <i>Alberti</i>, were <i>Zittman</i>,
<i>Richter</i>, and <i>Teichmeyer</i>, from whose writings
we have also had frequent occasion to extract some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii_b'>xii_b</span>valuable observations. In 1730 the progress of Medical
Jurisprudence was very considerably advanced
by the publication of the argumentative work of
<i>Storck</i>, in which the utility of medical knowledge in
assisting the operation of the laws, is very ably and
warmly advocated. The <cite>Anthropologia Forensis</cite> of
<i>Hebenstreit</i>, from which we have so frequently derived
useful information, did not appear until 1753,
and was followed by the <cite>Institutes of Ludwig</cite>, and
the <cite>Elements of Fazellius</cite>. In 1781, <i>Plenck</i><a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c011'><sup>[24]</sup></a> published
his Elementary work on Forensic Medicine and
Surgery; and in the following year the first volume
of <i>Haller</i>’s<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c011'><sup>[25]</sup></a> celebrated Lectures on Juridical
Medicine, in the execution of which he takes the Institutes
of <i>Teichmeyer</i> as his text, correcting his errors,
and amplifying his opinions. This work was subsequently
completed in three volumes. In 1784, <i>Daniel</i>,
by the title of his work<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c011'><sup>[26]</sup></a> published at Halle, first
introduced the term of <span class='sc'>State Medicine</span>, as expressive
of that branch of medical science of which we
are now treating. The annals of the close of the
eighteenth century are enriched by several important
productions; amongst which may be particularized
<cite>Conspectus of Sikora</cite><a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c011'><sup>[27]</sup></a>, the <cite>First Lines of Loder</cite><a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c011'><sup>[28]</sup></a>,
the <cite>System of Metzer</cite><a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a>, and the <cite>Delineations of
Muller</cite><a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c011'><sup>[30]</sup></a>. If the reader be desirous of further information
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii_b'>xiii_b</span>respecting the German literature of State
Medicine, at this period, we must refer him to the
great works of <i>Schlegel</i><a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c011'><sup>[31]</sup></a> and <i>Plouquet</i><a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c011'><sup>[32]</sup></a>; <i>Struvius</i>
likewise in his <cite>Bibliotheca Juris</cite>, (vol. i. p. 172)
refers to the work of <i>Andreas Otto Goellicke</i>, Frankfort,
1723, for an enumeration of the numerous medico-legal
writers of the earlier part of this age.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the present century we have received two
volumes from the pen of <i>Metzger</i>; and in the year
1806, <i>Knappe</i> and <i>Hecker</i> commenced at Berlin, a
periodical publication, under the title of “<cite>Critical
Annals of State Medicine</cite>;” some years after which
a similar work appeared under the superintendance
of <i>Professor Kopp</i> of Hanau. In speaking of the
periodical works of Germany, we must not omit to
mention that conducted by <i>Dr. Scherf</i>, Aulic Counsellor
at Detmold, under the title of “<cite>Contributions
to the Archives of Medical Police</cite>,” which extended
to eight volumes, and was afterwards continued under
the appellation of “<cite>Isis</cite>,” or “<cite>Journal of Medical
Jurisprudence and Police</cite>.” To the catalogue of
writers already enumerated, we might add many
more; but having cited the most celebrated works
we consider it unnecessary to adduce farther demonstration
of the indefatigable and laborious industry
of the German literati.</p>

<p class='c000'>The middle of the sixteenth century may be stated
as the epoch at which the subjects of Medical Jurisprudence
first excited much attention in the schools
of Italy. The earlier writers, however, would appear
to have studied the science rather with casuistical,
than physiological views. <i>Fortunatus Fidelis</i>, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv_b'>xiv_b</span>has been regarded as the father of the Medico-legal
literature of Italy, first published his work “<cite>De Relationibus
Medicorum</cite>,” at Palermo, about the period
above stated; it was afterwards republished at Venice,
and lastly at Leipsic, under the care of <i>Paul
Amman</i>, Professor of Botany and Physiology in that
University. It consists of four books, of which the
following may be received as an outline of the contents,
<i>viz.</i> I. On Public Food; the Salubrity of the
Air; Pestilence. II. Wounds; Pretended Diseases;
Torture; Injuries of the Muscles; Medical Errors.
III. Virginity; Impotence; Hereditary Diseases;
Pregnancy; Moles; the Vitality of the Fœtus; On
Birth; Monsters. IV. Life and Death; Mortality
of Wounds; Suffocation; Death by Lightning and
Poisoning.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amongst the earliest dissertations which appeared
on questions connected with the subject of Jurisprudence,
and which merits notice on this occasion, is
one by <i>Frederic Bonaventura</i>, an eminent scholar
and physician of Urbino, in Italy, who flourished in
the early part of the seventeenth century, entitled,
“<cite>De Natura partus octomestris, adversus vulgarem
opinionem, libri decem.</cite>” Francof. 1601; an enormous
folio volume, containing upwards of one thousand
pages, on this uninteresting subject; in which
he has introduced the opinions of different writers,
and an account of all the controversies that have been
held on the legitimate period of utero-gestation.
The most celebrated however of all the Italian works
which have descended to us, is that of <i>Paul Zacchias</i>,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c011'><sup>[33]</sup></a>
physician to Pope Innocent the Tenth, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv_b'>xv_b</span>was long considered as the only arbiter of questions
relating to any of the subjects of Juridical Medicine.
The estimation in which this work was universally
held may be easily discovered, from the expressions
with which it is mentioned by all cotemporary writers.
<i>Zacutus Lusitanus</i>, in alluding to its value, exclaims
“Emi,—vidi—legi—obstupui”! When we consider
the period at which it was written, it must certainly
be acknowledged as a very extraordinary work; that
it should be overrun with casuistical subtleties cannot
be a matter of surprise; the style too is entirely
scholastic, full of digression, and prolix passages of
erudition, but such was the taste of the age in which
it was composed. We are also to remember that at
this period, the philosophy of <i>Aristotle</i> alone directed
the schools, and the doctrines of <i>Galen</i>, illustrated
by a thousand servile commentators were, according
to the judgment of that æra, the only sources from
which medical opinions could be legitimately deduced.
The study of Anatomy had only then commenced
under the guidance of <i>Vesalius</i>, <i>Columbus</i>,
<i>Fallopius</i>, and <i>Eustachius</i>; while Surgery, notwithstanding
the labours of <i>Paré</i>, <i>Arceus</i>, <i>Andrew Dalla
Croce</i>, <i>Aqua Pendente</i>, and other masters, was in its
mere infancy. Chemistry too was as yet full of conceit
and uncertainty; and Pharmacy was absolutely
without any acknowledged principles. As the great
work of <i>Zacchias</i> was composed at different periods,
with considerable intervals between each, we find
numerous repetitions, and contradictions. It is therefore
evident, that although the “<cite>Quæstiones Medico-legales</cite>”
may afford much instruction to the learned
physician, it can be of no service to the student; this
opinion is justly expressed by “<i>Camerarius</i><a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c011'><sup>[34]</sup></a>—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quisquis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi_b'>xvi_b</span>Pauli Zacchiæ opus legere cum fructu voluerit,
insigni jam rerum medicarum notitia instructus
sit oportet; eo magis quod alia sit modernæ Medicinæ
facies; ditissimus enim thesaurus est liber iste, supplendus
tamen subinde ex aliis fontibus recentioribus.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Barnardin Ramazzini</i>, having been struck with the
numerous accidents which had occurred to Nightmen,
was induced to direct his attention to the causes and
nature of the asphyxia by which they perished, and to
extend his investigation to the maladies to which the
artisans in every profession were more peculiarly
subjected. He accordingly, in the year 1700, published
at Padua, an excellent treatise on these affections,
entitled “<cite>De Morbis Artificum Diatriba</cite>,”
a work which has retained its credit as a standard
production, and to which all subsequent works on
the same subject have been very largely indebted.
It was translated by <i>Fourcroy</i>, who also enriched
it with many valuable notes in 1777. It has also
been presented to the public in many other countries,
at different periods, and under various forms; as by
<i>M. Hecquet</i>, 1740; <i>Skragge</i>, in 1764; <i>Bertrand</i>, in
1804; <i>Gosse</i> of Geneva, in 1516; and <i>Patissier</i>, in
1822.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1749, Professor <i>Beccaria</i>, of Bononia, published
his work entitled <cite>Scriptura Medico-Legalis</cite>, and
<i>Bononi</i> in his <cite>Istruzioni Teorico pratiche di Chirurg</cite>:
entered with considerable minuteness into the subject
of Forensic Surgery, especially in its relations to
wounds. The later production however, of <i>Giuseppe
Tortosa</i><a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c011'><sup>[35]</sup></a>, the disciple of <i>Caldani</i>, must be considered
as the most elaborate and scientific of all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii_b'>xvii_b</span>Italian works on Medical Jurisprudence. The reader
will find that we have frequently referred to this
author; and it is just to state, that during the progress
of our labours we have derived from him no inconsiderable
assistance, in ascertaining the sentiments
of the Medical Jurists of the Italian school, upon
various casuistical as well as physiological doctrines.
The work is professed to have been written with the
sanction of his master, <i>Caldani</i>, and under the auspices
of <i>Franck</i> of Pavia, and of <i>Plouquet</i> of Turin.
He includes in his plan such subjects only as relate to
Forensic Medicine, excluding those which belong
more correctly to the department of Medical Police.
The work is divided into three parts, <i>viz.</i> 1. Comprehending
all the principal objects of <i>Ecclesiastical</i>
jurisdiction. 2. Subjects relating to the <em>Civil</em> courts.
3. Those which relate to the <em>Criminal</em> courts. The
subdivisions of each part are arranged in the following
order. <span class='sc'>Part I.</span>—Conjugal Impotence.—Conjugal
Rites.—Monstrous Births.—Hermaphrodites.—Magic.—Of
Persons possessed of Spirits.—Miracles.—Ecclesiastical
Fasting. <span class='sc'>Part II.</span> Age.—Pregnancy.—Birth.—Superfœtation.—Cæsarean Operation.—Simulated
and Dissimulated Diseases. <span class='sc'>Part
III.</span> Of Deflowering.—Sodomy.—Torture.—Legal
Examination of Wounds, and Dead Bodies.—Poisoning.—Infanticide.—Homicide
by wounding.—Fœticide.—Accidental
Death.</p>

<p class='c000'>The application of Medical science to jurisprudence
may, practically considered, be said to have commenced
in France about the time of Francis I; but it
was not until after the publication of the <cite>Constitutio
Criminalis Carolina</cite>, that the French government,
unwilling to allow their criminal code to remain
less perfect and refined than that of their continental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii_b'>xviii_b</span>neighbours, decreed that the assistance of physicians
and surgeons should be legally required; and which
was at length rendered still more peremptory by
letters patent granted by Henry IV, in 1606, conferring
upon his first physician the privilege of nominating
surgeons in every town to the exclusive exercise
of this important duty; and Louis XIV. in 1667,
after having formally declared, that all Reports which
had not received the sanction of such an officer
should be invalid, ordered by a decree, in 1692, that
a physician shall always be present with the surgeon,
at the examination of a body<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c011'><sup>[36]</sup></a>; the surgeons, however,
of those times were not distinguished by the
knowledge which they now possess; hence, in every
thing that did not directly involve surgical discussion
and practice, their reports were frequently defective.
Magistrates were consequently induced to summon
the more learned physician to the assistance of the
Juridical Surgeon, long before it was enforced by the
law; a practice, which like many others, acquired force
and regularity from repetition.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Ambrose Paré</i> is acknowledged as the first French
writer on the subject of Juridical Medicine, and his
treatise on Reports, published in 1575, was, for
nearly a century, regarded as the only standard
authority upon these occasions; it was, however, at
length, to a great degree, superseded by the more
accomplished treatises of <i>Gendri</i> of Angers, in 1650,
of <i>Blegni</i> of Lyons, in 1684, and of <i>Deveaux</i> of
Paris, in 1693. This latter work is one of very considerable
merit, especially as it regards the diagnosis
and prognosis of wounds.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xix_b'>xix_b</span>The eighteenth century, says <i>Foderé</i><a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c011'><sup>[37]</sup></a>, an æra
remarkable for the conversion of the human mind
from the enthusiasm of poetry and the fine arts, to
the cultivation and study of the exact sciences, must
be considered as the auspicious dawn of medico-legal
knowledge in France. The spirit of emulation which
animated the rival schools of Surgery and Medicine,
produced men, who enlightened by their talents every
department of the science of Medicine. Professor
<i>Louis</i>, Secretary to the Academy of Surgery, taught
publicly in the schools the art of resolving different
questions in medical jurisprudence, which previous to
his time had never been practised. Numerous memoirs
on its various branches appeared in succession;
eloquence allied itself to science, and their combined
efforts were displayed in this novel mode of benefiting
mankind. Upon the great principles of justice and humanity
which presided at the reform of the penal code,
chairs of medical jurisprudence were established in all
the faculties of medicine. In 1788, <i>Louis</i> published at
Paris his letters on the certainty of the signs of death,
in answer to the dissertations of <i>Winslow</i> and <i>Bruhier</i>;
and of whose judicious remarks we have availed
ourselves in the discussion of the subjects of “Real
and Apparent Death.” (<i>Vol. II. p. 15</i>). To the
same author we are also indebted for memoirs on
Drowning, and on the means of distinguishing Suicide
from Assassination in cases of death by suspension.
His Consultations on the celebrated causes of <i>Monbailly</i>,
<i>Syrven</i>, <i>Calas</i>, <i>Cassagneux</i>, and <i>Baronet</i>, which
are recorded in the “<i>Causes Célébres</i>,” must serve
to exalt him still higher in our estimation. <i>Winslow</i>
engaged his talents in the investigation of the Cæsarean
Operation, including its moral, political, and religious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx_b'>xx_b</span>relations. <i>Petit</i> and <i>Bouvart</i> entered the field
as controversialists, and disputed the opinions of
<i>Louis</i> on protracted pregnancy, with considerable
ability. The former of these philosophers wrote also
several memoirs on the phenomena of suspension and
strangulation; he, moreover, examined the question
relative to the signs of death from abstinence. <i>Lorry</i>
discussed the question of survivorship with great
acuteness and judgment. <i>Salin</i> attempted to deduce
from the character of the organic lesions, an inference
with respect to the nature of the poison that inflicted
them; and he illustrated this opinion in an
elaborate memoir on the research of the traces of
poison on the body of <i>Lamotte</i>, sixty-seven days after
it had been deposited in the earth; in which he decides
that the death was occasioned by <em>corrosive sublimate</em>.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c011'><sup>[38]</sup></a>
And although the nice distinctions which
this ingenious writer laboured to establish never had
any existence but in his own imagination, yet the
agitation of so important a question was by no means
unprofitable; it directed the attention of the physician
to the state of the organic lesions, and has ultimately
led to some useful conclusions. While <i>Salin</i>
was thus engaged on the subject of poisoning, <i>Lafosse</i>
sought to distinguish the phenomena produced
by death, from the traces of violence inflicted during
life upon the body. He, moreover, developed the
unequivocal signs of pregnancy and parturition.
<i>Professor Chaussier</i>, in the year 1789, by a memoir,
to the Academy of Sciences at Dijon, on the great
importance of the study of juridical medicine, excited
a spirit of emulation which was productive of the
highest advantage. At about this period also the memorable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi_b'>xxi_b</span>“<cite>Encyclopédie Méthodique</cite>,” was undertaken,
in which the celebrated authors already named
contributed their powerful assistance, in conjunction
with <i>Professor Mahon</i>, in compiling the elaborate
articles upon Medical Jurisprudence. Such were the
materials, says <i>M. Foderé</i>, which enabled me to publish
my first systematic work<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c011'><sup>[39]</sup></a> on this science in the
year 1796.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the first few years of the present century the
science of juridical medicine received numerous contributions
from the French physicians. <i>M. Vigné</i>,
of Rouen, published in 1805 his humane and enlightened
reflections upon its practical applications;
a work which bears internal evidence of the science as
well as the judgment of its author. In the year 1807,
the system of <i>Professor Mahon</i> appeared, not, however,
until after the death of its author; <i>M. Fautrel</i>
having undertaken the charge of arranging the manuscript,
of illustrating it with notes, and of giving it to
the world.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c011'><sup>[40]</sup></a> Nearly at the same time the small,
but useful work of <i>Belloc</i><a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c011'><sup>[41]</sup></a> was published; and in
the following year <i>Marc</i><a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c011'><sup>[42]</sup></a> translated the German
manual of <i>Rose</i> on juridical dissection, and enriched it
with original observations; to which he also subjoined
two memoirs on the obscure subject of the “<cite>Docimasia
Pulmonaris</cite>.” We have deemed it necessary to introduce
to our readers this slight sketch of the literary
history of Medical Jurisprudence in relation to its
progress in the several countries of Germany, Italy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii_b'>xxii_b</span>and France; for much of the information thus afforded
we are indebted to the elaborate system of <i>Professor
Foderé</i>,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c011'><sup>[43]</sup></a> published in six volumes, in the year
1813, and which must be regarded as a new work,
rather than the republication of that already noticed,
as having appeared in 1796. From this voluminous
treatise we have frequently, in the progress of our
present undertaking, made copious extracts. It becomes
our duty therefore to present our reader with
some account of the extent of its objects, and the order
of their arrangement. The author divides his
work into three parts, viz. the <em>First</em> comprehending
subjects of a mixed nature, or those which admit of
application to civil as well as criminal cases, “<cite>Médecine
Légale mixte</cite>.” The <em>Second</em> exclusively relating
to criminal jurisprudence, “<cite>Médecine Légale
Criminelle</cite>;” and the <em>Third</em>, to medical police, “<cite>Médecine
Légale Sanitaire</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The work opens with a learned introduction, in
which the importance of the science is fairly examined,
and its history pursued with much detail, from its
origin, to the period at which the author wrote. The
qualifications of the forensic physician are also considered,
and the different circumstances opposed to
the success of his labours, enumerated and appreciated.
Then follow in succession the subjects of the
first division, viz. the different ages of human life,
puberty, minority, majority, with the anomalies to
which the natural growth and developement of the
body are liable. Personal identity and resemblance.
The relative and absolute duration of life. The
grounds of prohibition in testatorship, such as habitual,
periodical, and temporary insanity; suicide;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii_b'>xxiii_b</span>deaf and dumb state; somnambulism; intoxication.
The qualifications of testators and witnesses. Marriage
and divorce. Pregnancy, true and false. Parturition,
and the signs denoting the death of the fœtus
in utero. Paternity and filiation. Premature and
retarded births. Monsters. Hermaphrodites. Survivorship.
Signs of real and apparent death. Treatment
of the different varieties of Asphyxia. Certificates
of exemption, and diseases which exempt.
Feigned, dissimulated, and imputed maladies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>Second</em> division commences with the third volume,
and includes, in their respective order, chapters
on the examination of bodies found dead. The
distinction of assassination from suicide. Wounds.
Poisoning. Rape. Abortion. Concealment and substitution
of the offspring; and Infanticide.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>Third</em> division, with which the fifth volume
commences, successively treats of the preservation of
the human species, and of the means of remedying its
physical degeneracy. Contagious, hereditary, and
epidemic diseases, and the precautions to be adopted
against them. The medical police of cities, with regard
to aliment, arts, manufactures, and attention to
the sick. Military and naval hygiène; and, lastly,
the medical police of hospitals and prisons.</p>

<p class='c000'>No work of similar calibre had been previously
published, and its execution is a sufficient proof of
the profound erudition and sterling ability of its
author; but it is by no means calculated to assist the
inquiries of the English physician. It is often unnecessarily
prolix and minute, and is adapted only to the
judicial courts of the continent. Since its publication
numerous writers on detached questions have sprung
up, and thrown much additional light on their obscurer
points. The subject of poisons has been very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv_b'>xxiv_b</span>ably elucidated by the researches of <i>Professor Orfila</i><a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c011'><sup>[44]</sup></a>,
and in a work<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c011'><sup>[45]</sup></a> still more recently published by
that distinguished professor, the applications of Toxicological
Science to Forensic inquiries have been
more minutely considered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subjects of conception and delivery, with the
various questions to which they have given origin,
have been very ably discussed by <i>M. Capuron</i>;<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c011'><sup>[46]</sup></a>
from whose work it will be perceived we have derived
much satisfactory information.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the historical view which we have taken of the
continental literature of the subject, we fear that the
labours of our own countrymen, in this department of
science, will suffer a disparaging comparison; and yet
we trust that any temporary feeling of inferiority and
humiliation thus excited, will easily yield to the just
conception of the circumstances to which the neglect
of the subject is to be attributed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although numerous questions connected with objects
of forensic inquiry had been discussed and illustrated
in the various periodical journals of Great Britain,
yet no work, professing to treat of Medical Jurisprudence,
appeared previous to the small and imperfect
production of <i>Dr. Farre</i> in 1788, entitled “<cite>Elements
of Medical Jurisprudence</cite>,”<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c011'><sup>[47]</sup></a> and which was rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv_b'>xxv_b</span>an abstract of a foreign work, than an original essay.
The next in succession was a “<cite>Treatise on Medical
Police</cite>,” by <i>Dr. Robertson</i>, in two volumes, published
in 1808. In 1815 <i>Dr. Bartley</i>, of Bristol,
presented us with “<cite>A Treatise on Forensic Medicine</cite>,”
than which it is impossible to conceive any production
more meagre or imperfect. <i>Dr. Male</i><a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c011'><sup>[48]</sup></a> is
undoubtedly entitled to the grateful notice of the medical
historian, as the author of the first respectable
English book on forensic medicine.</p>

<p class='c000'>The last, and by far the most comprehensive and
instructive work that has appeared in this country, is
by <i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i>, entitled “<cite>The Principles of
Forensic Medicine, systematically arranged, and applied
to British Practice</cite>.” London, 1821.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the above writings, we may record
the “<cite>Medical Ethics</cite>” of <i>Dr. Percival</i>; which, although
not intended, nor indeed calculated for practical
instruction, contains some interesting allusions
to our subject. Nor must we omit to enumerate the
several valuable monographs with which different
English physicians have sought to advance the progress
of medico-legal inquiry; as, for instance, the
celebrated paper of <i>Dr. Hunter</i>, “<cite>On the Uncertainty
of the Signs of Murder in the case of Bastard
Children</cite>;” <i>Dr. Haslam’s</i> intelligent and judicious
essay “<cite>On Medical Jurisprudence, as it relates to Insanity,
according to the Law of England</cite>;” and <i>Dr.
Hutchinson’s</i> laborious “<cite>Dissertation on Infanticide</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the more important subjects of Public
Health, received also early notice, and were very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi_b'>xxvi_b</span>ably investigated by our physicians. The plan of
ventilating the holds and lower decks of ships, as
proposed by <i>Sutton</i> in 1739, must have fallen into
total neglect, through the unaccountable prejudice
of the Admiralty, had it not received the powerful
support of <i>Dr. Mead</i>, by whose advice experiments
were publicly made, the success of which was, in the
year 1741, acknowledged in an order of his Majesty
that all vessels belonging to the Navy should be provided
with ventilators. About the same period <i>Hales</i>
published his celebrated memoir on the various causes
which influence the health of seafaring men, and on
the precautions necessary to be taken to prevent those
maladies which frequently display themselves in ships
and other confined situations; among which modes
of safety the most important was a plan of ventilation
by means of very ingenious bellows, and which were
used with much success in the prisons of Porchester
castle, Winchester, and Newgate;<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c011'><sup>[49]</sup></a> and in the
several hospitals of London, Bristol, and Northampton.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1803, on the presentation of a memorial
to his late Majesty’s ministers, urging the expediency
of a Professorship of Medical Jurisprudence, in
the University of Edinburgh, a Chair was endowed,
and <i>Dr. Duncan, junior</i>, appointed to fulfil its duties;
which, for many years he has continued to perform,
with infinite credit to himself, and with equal advantage
to the University and to the public. In the schools
of England we continue to suffer from the want of
such an establishment; <i>Dr. Harrison</i>, a few years
since, read some lectures on the subject in the Medical
Theatre of Windmill street; and <i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii_b'>xxvii_b</span>has announced his intention of devoting himself to
the duties of a public lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence.
<i>Dr. Elliotson</i> has also lately published his
“Introductory Lecture of a Course upon State Medicine,”
which he proposes to deliver in the Anatomical
Theatre in Southwark.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it has been demanded, and in a tone, as it
would seem, suggested by the feelings of mortified
pride and disappointment, how it can have happened
that in Britain, a country distinguished above all
others for the unceasing jealousy and circumspection
with which every thing that even remotely interests
the life and comfort of the subject is scrupulously
regarded, a science so peculiarly calculated to control
the disorders of the social system, to rescue innocence
from infamy or death, and to lead to the detection
and punishment of crime, should for so long a
period have been imperfectly appreciated, and utterly
neglected?</p>

<p class='c000'>The answer to the charge is obvious, and, we trust,
satisfactory. The progress of medical knowledge, including
its collateral branches of science, can only
within a few years be said to have rendered its applications
available to the laws; while the spirit of British
liberty and independence not only resists the perpetual
intrusion of authorities, so necessary in other
countries for the preservation of the public health,
but insures, without the aid of legal enactments, all
the benefits which can accrue from domestic cleanliness
and attention.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a> But upon each of these
points it will be necessary to offer some farther remarks.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii_b'>xxviii_b</span>That the evidence afforded by an improving, but
still precarious and imperfect physiology, should have
been indiscriminately received at the tribunals of those
countries where the decision of questions of justice is
too often influenced, and even directed by the subtleties
of casuistry, may be regarded as a subject of regret,
but can scarcely excite the feeling of astonishment.
Nor can we, on the other hand, be surprised
to find, that the extreme jealously of the British
courts of judicature should have resisted testimony
which admits of being depreciated, or in any degree
rendered questionable, by the doubtful controversies
of science. So rapid, however, has been the progress
of the leading branches of medical knowledge
during the last ten years; and so successfully have
they disentangled themselves from the many fatal fallacies
with which they were encompassed, that the
general prejudice against their practical utility, in
advancing the administration of justice, must gradually
subside, and the study of forensic medicine become
universally popular. To strengthen our conviction
upon this point we have only to compare the
evidence of medical men, as delivered in the courts of
justice during the last, and present century. Even
so late as the period of <i>Sir Thomas Browne</i>, we find
that learned physician bearing public testimony to the
reality of diabolical illusions, and occasioning, by
his evidence, the conviction and condemnation of two
unfortunate persons, who were tried at Bury St. Edmonds
before the Lord Chief Baron <i>Sir Mathew Hale</i>,
on the capital charge of bewitching the children of a
<i>Mr. Pacey</i>, and causing them to have fits!<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c011'><sup>[51]</sup></a> In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix_b'>xxix_b</span>examining the chemical evidence in cases of poisoning,
let us only compare that which was given by
<i>Dr. Addington</i> on the trial of <i>Mary Blandy</i>, at Oxford
in 1752, (<i>see Appendix, p. 236</i>) with that which
has been delivered on any of the trials of the present
day. Compare again the nature of the physiological
evidence which has been received as satisfactory and
conclusive, in cases of infanticide, with that which is
acknowledged by the most distinguished physicians of
our own times to be wholly inadequate to establish
even a presumption of guilt.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the next point under consideration,
viz. the expediency of an extended system of medical
police in a free country like Great Britain, we have
only to observe that, if we examine the extent of
such institutions in the different states of Europe,
we shall find it universally conformable with the
genius, circumstances, and necessities of each government.
Sweden, for instance, a country which
from position, climate, and population, is relatively
feeble, has found it necessary, for its very existence,
to cultivate with assiduity the few resources which
nature has bestowed upon it; and, hence, by a
well digested system of medical statistics,<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c011'><sup>[52]</sup></a> it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx_b'>xxx_b</span>has been enabled to achieve extraordinary and brilliant
actions, and to repair immense losses which
it would otherwise have been unable to survive.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Paris there exists a complete system of “<i>Assainissement</i>,”
or police for the preservation of the public
health. Its administration devolves upon <i>M. le
Préfet de Police</i>, who for some years resorted to
chemists and physicians for advice upon the different
questions that might arise; upon such occasions, however,
it is evident that he could only obtain that isolated
advice, which, for want of having been properly
discussed, was frequently arbitrary and weak; he had
indeed sometimes temporary commissions, which were
formed when any important problem was to be solved.
In the year 1802 a council of health was, on
the recommendation of <i>M. Cadet de Gassicourt</i>, permanently
established. At first it only consisted of
four members; but the new avocations required day
by day, so multiplied their labours, that they were
compelled in 1807 to increase the number of members
composing it to seven; and the particular attention
necessary to be paid to epidemical diseases determined
<i>M. le Préfet</i> to add to it two physicians. The duties
of this council of health were, to watch over all insalubrious
manufactories and workshops; to collect observations
on epidemics, and on the sources from
whence they arose. They had, moreover, the charge
of superintending the cleansing of the markets, rivers,
slaughter-houses, butchers offal, burying-places,
sewers, &amp;c. and also of inspecting the public baths;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi_b'>xxxi_b</span>the manufactories of the artificial, and the depots
of the natural mineral waters; the amphitheatres
for dissection; of making statistical researches on the
bills of mortality; on the means of rendering the
theatres, hospitals, and other public places more salubrious;
on the best system for heating and lighting;
on the composition of secret remedies; suspected
vessels, &amp;c. When this council received its definite
organization, it was composed of the following persons,
whose names are a sufficient guarantee of the
ability with which the duties of the establishment
must have been performed—<i>M. D’Arcet</i>, <i>M. Le
Chevalier Cadet de Gassicourt</i>, <i>MM. Deyeux</i>, <i>Berard</i>,
<i>Huzard</i>, <i>Leroux</i>, <i>Dupuytren</i>, <i>Pariset</i>, <i>Petit</i>, <i>Marc</i>,
and <i>Girard</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>An establishment similarly constituted in this country,
that should from time to time report its labours
to the home department, would without doubt be
attended with much advantage, and might suggest
many police regulations highly conducive to the
health and welfare of the community.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the severity of the French system of police,
“Pharmaco-legale,” the reader may form some idea,
when we inform him that, during the progress of the
present work through the press, an apothecary of
Verdun has been fined three thousand francs, for selling
sulphuric acid to a woman who had poisoned
herself with it. We are very far from objecting to
such a system, especially where the respectability
and knowledge of the vender are not guaranteed by an
adequate power vested in some medical corporation.
In Germany a mistaken policy exists of regulating
every thing connected with health by the law, and
which has led to the formation of a cumbrous code of
contradictory, and often, injurious enactments.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii_b'>xxxii_b</span>The legislature of Britain has been accused of apathy
upon all subjects in which the prosperity of
commerce is not involved, and upon such occasions
it is said to display a morbid vigilance and activity;
“so truly mercantile are the English,” observes
<i>Professor Raynal</i>, “that they mix up commerce
with their philosophy, and even with their religion;”
as a proof of this, he instances <i>Mr. Locke</i>,
who, amongst his arguments for converting the Indians,
adds that, “by being thus induced to cover their
naked bodies, they would add to the consumption of
British manufactures.” We do not admit the allegation,
and may be allowed to ask, in what country
the fruits of commerce are more liberally devoted
to the encouragement of science, or to the promotion
of religion? In truth, the benefits which are enforced
by the legal enactments of other countries, are
in England the spontaneous consequence of individual
liberality; and what is that repose which the jealousy
of our rival neighbours has denominated apathy, but
the placid expression of satisfaction experienced by
the whole community at the active liberality of the
numerous individuals of which it is composed? We
are, nevertheless, willing to admit that occasions do
exist in which the interference of the legislature might
be made subservient to the preservation of the public
health; and, in the course of our work, we have not
felt any hesitation in directing the attention of the
reader to their several merits. We have, in particular,
recommended some enactments in cases of epidemic
disease. Under such circumstances of public
calamity the people naturally look for the sympathy
and support of their government; and the general
confidence inspired by a public act, however unimportant
in itself, will always be attended with advantage;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii_b'>xxxiii_b</span>it will have the tendency to diminish the susceptibility
of the people, and to limit the ravages of disease.
The sages of ancient Rome were deeply sensible
of this important fact in the œconomy of the
people; whenever, therefore, their city was threatened
with pestilence, a dictator was elected with
great solemnity, for the sole purpose of driving a nail
into the wall of the temple of Jupiter; and thus,
while they imagined that they propitiated an offended
deity, they diminished the susceptibility to disease,
by appeasing their own fears.</p>

<p class='c000'>Much benefit might also be conferred on the operative
classes of society, by some judicious enactments
that should ensure the adoption of the various
plans of safety and protection, which science has
from time to time discovered for the advantage of
those who are engaged in the more dangerous occupations
and manufactories; but which, from the apathy
of some, and the prejudice of others, have been
either heedlessly neglected, or illiberally and insolently
repulsed. The blind opposition, which such
inventions meet with, is well illustrated in the history
of the <em>safety lamp</em> of <i>Sir Humphry Davy</i>, an instrument
which has completely succeeded in use, and
yet such is the obstinacy of the miners, that many of
them continue to expose their own lives, and those of
their companions, by carrying open lanterns about
the galleries of the mines. The author of the present
work has personally experienced the same mortifying
insensibility and opposition, in his attempts to prevent
the awful accidents that so frequently occur in
the mines of Cornwall, from the premature explosion
of gunpowder,<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c011'><sup>[53]</sup></a> in the operation of blasting rocks.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiv_b'>xxxiv_b</span>In the processes of <em>needle-pointing</em> and <em>dry-grinding</em>,
the artisans rarely live many years, in consequence
of the organic mischief produced in the pulmonary
organs, from the fine metallic particles that
are inhaled during the operation; to obviate such a
source of danger, the Society of Arts offered a premium
for any invention that might afford security, and
their gold medal was, in consequence, presented to
<i>Mr. Abraham</i>, of Sheffield, for his “<em>magnetic guard</em>.”
Notwithstanding the expediency of this apparatus,
we understand that the greatest opposition has been
manifested by the workmen to its introduction. From
the extreme danger of the process their wages are very
high, and they fear that the adaption of any system
that may diminish the risk will be followed by a corresponding
reduction in their pay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Surely such a subject well deserves the attention of
the legislature. In France the <i>Prefet de Police</i> would
prohibit the carrying on of such arts, unless every
means of safety were applied. Such a measure was
adopted in the case of the <em>water-gilders</em> in Paris, who
hesitated to employ the means of ventilation suggested
by <i>M. d’Arcet</i> for their security. It is not
our intention to recommend a jurisdiction so absolute
and summary, but some enactments should be framed
that might secure the safety of the artisan, without
infringing upon the liberty of the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wherever governments have interfered for the
purpose of encouraging and rewarding, or of prohibiting
and restraining, particular medical opinions
or practices, the inexpediency of such interference
has generally been soon discovered and demonstrated.
What could have been more absurd than the attempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxv_b'>xxxv_b</span>of the French parliament to proscribe the use of antimony,<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c011'><sup>[54]</sup></a>
or the sale of poppy oil;<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c011'><sup>[55]</sup></a> or the enactments
of the different governments of Europe to restrain
the custom of smoking tobacco.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c011'><sup>[56]</sup></a> The pension
conferred by the French government upon <i>M.
Sigault</i><a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c011'><sup>[57]</sup></a> for the invention of a new mode of facilitating
delivery, in cases of difficult parturition; and the
medal which was struck to commemorate it, were
measures not less inconsiderate and absurd than the
vote, by our own parliament, of five thousand pounds
to <i>Mrs. Stephens</i> for the supposed discovery of a medicine
that could dissolve a calculus in the bladder.
But it may be said that we are reasoning against the
propriety of a practice from its abuse—That may be
very true; but our object is to shew that such a practice
is pre-eminently exposed to fallacy and abuse.
We profess ourselves, generally, hostile to the policy
of remunerating medical discoveries, as they have
been termed, by grants of money; although we cheerfully
tender our homage and thanks for the great service
rendered this country and the world, by the liberal
support which the government has afforded to the
cause of vaccination; and were the minister even
now to withdraw the necessary supplies for the continuance
of the vaccine board, the consequences that
would, under such circumstances, ensue, afford a
subject of the most awful consideration.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to the view which we have taken of the
subject of medical police, as necessary to the welfare
of this country, our attention is necessarily directed
to the Royal College of Physicians, as the only legitimate
source from which the government is to derive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvi_b'>xxxvi_b</span>its information, and the public their protection. No
apology therefore can be necessary for the minute
research by which we have endeavoured to ascertain
and establish their existing rights and privileges.
Under any circumstances it must be an object of the
first importance to the profession, but at the present
period the inquiry would seem to be marked with a
more than ordinary degree of interest, as the anticipated
removal of the College, and the increased attention
which has been recently drawn to the subject, appear
to promise considerable improvements not only
in the interior arrangement of that learned body, but
also in their public relations.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'>It now only remains for us to offer some observations
upon the plan and execution of the work before
us.</p>

<p class='c000'>The classification of the various topics of forensic
medicine has ever been a fertile source of controversy;
and we will venture to assert that, from the diversity,
as well as versatility of the numerous subjects
involved in the study of medical jurisprudence, no
arrangement can ever be constructed which shall vie,
in perspicuity and precision, with that of most branches
of natural science, the objects of which, however numerous,
maintain a mutual relationship, and admit
of being displayed in a striking and natural order of
connection. If an arrangement be attempted to meet
the legal view of the subject, such, for instance as
that proposed by <i>Professor Plenck</i>, of Vienna, and
adopted by <i>Tortosa</i> and many others, viz. of distributing
the subjects according as they relate to the
<em>criminal</em>, <em>civil</em>, or <em>ecclesiastical</em> court, we shall immediately
perceive that the same subject will frequently
belong with as much propriety to one division, as to
another, and may require to be considered under all;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxix_b'>xxxix_b</span>thus, insanity must come before a <em>civil</em> court when
the person is supposed incapable of managing his own
affairs; and before a <em>criminal</em> tribunal, when the
soundness of a murderer’s intellect is disputed. <i>Professor
Foderé</i>, it must be admitted, escapes from this
difficulty by creating, under the term “<cite>Medecine Lègale
mixte</cite>,” a division that comprehends subjects appertaining
at once to the civil and criminal law; but
it will be immediately perceived that such a scheme is
far too general and indefinite to ensure the advantages
of systematic arrangement, or even to merit the
appellation of a classification. If, on the other hand,
an arrangement be projected upon purely physiological
and pathological principles, such as that adopted
by <i>Valentini</i>, in his “<cite>Corpus juris Medico-legale</cite>,”
and which was followed by <i>Roose</i>, and very lately
preferred by <i>Dr. Elliotson</i>,<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c011'><sup>[58]</sup></a> we shall find that similar
embarrassments will arise, with respect to their
legal relations, as we have just stated must attend
their physiological bearings, where the basis of the
classification has an exclusive reference to the law.
The same objections will apply to the divisions of our
respected cotemporary <i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i>, who appears
to have appreciated all the difficulties of the
subject, and, like ourselves, to have despaired of the
success of any attempt to surmount them. He arranges
the subjects of forensic medicine into three
parts, viz. 1. <em>Those which regard the extinction of human
life</em>; particularly by unusual or violent means;
such are many kinds of sudden death, and all cases of
homicide. 2. <em>Injuries done to the person, not leading
to the extinction of life</em>; such are disfiguring and
maiming, causing diseases, the violation of females,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xl_b'>xl_b</span>&amp;c. 3. <em>Circumstances connected with the physical system,
that disqualify for the discharge of civil offices, or
the exercise of social functions</em>; such are mental alienation,
the existence of certain diseases, the want of
certain organs, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>After mature consideration, the arrangement which
has been followed on the present occasion, although
greatly liable to the many objections which we have
so strongly urged against that of other writers, appears
to the authors to be the one best calculated to
accomplish the mixed objects of the publication. The
ample synopsis of this arrangement, as presented in
the table of contents prefixed to the present volume,
would render any detailed account, in this place,
superfluous. We have only to observe that the work
is divided into three parts, the <em>first</em> comprehending
the enumeration of the different medical corporations,
with an account of their charters, powers, and privileges,
together with the subjects of medical police.
The <em>second</em>, all those subjects connected with medical
evidence, as applicable to <em>civil</em> and <em>ecclesiastical</em> suits,
in which the order of the subject corresponds with
that of the progress of human life from infancy to old
age. The <em>third</em>, the inquiries which are necessary to
medical evidence, as applicable to <em>criminal</em> cases.</p>

<p class='c000'>In limiting the boundaries of each division, it will
be perceived that we have strictly adhered to the general
principle of excluding every topic that had not
some direct or constructive relation to the health,
life, and physical welfare of the subject. Had we
regarded chemistry as synonimous with medicine, and
pursued the numerous subjects in which it might be
rendered available in the construction, elucidation,
and administration of the laws, we should have far
exceeded the scope of our labours, and have wandered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xli_b'>xli_b</span>into a rich and imperfectly explored region, as
boundless in its extent, as it is interesting in the novelty
and utility of its productions. In this case the
subject of patents would have formed a prominent feature
in the second division of our work; for so rapid
is the progress of chemical science, and so precarious
the language by which its growing objects and phenomena
are expressed, that, in the present state of
the law, it becomes an extremely delicate task to
draw the specification of a chemical patent in such
terms as to escape the snares which ingenuity is ever
ready to invent for its destruction. We cannot, perhaps,
better exemplify the truth of this position than
by the relation of a case that has lately excited a considerable
share of public interest. A patent was
granted to <i>Messrs. Hall</i> and <i>Urling</i>, for a new mode
of manufacturing lace. The merit of the improvement
turned upon the mode of singeing or burning
off the raw ends of the cotton by a flame of gas,
which was made to play rapidly through the
meshes of the lace, instead of the red hot cylinder,
over which it is commonly passed. The infringement
of this patent by <i>Boote</i> formed the grounds
of the action. The defendant stated that he had employed
the flame of burning alcohol for this purpose,
which not being a <em>gas</em>, but a <em>vapour</em>, could not be
said to fall within the meaning of the plaintiff’s specification.
Fortunately for the justice of the case, an
additional apparatus was required to draw the flame
through the meshes of the lace, and, without such a contrivance,
the operation whatever might be the nature
of the combustible <em>gas</em>, or <em>vapour</em>, employed, could not
succeed; and since it is an acknowledged principle
that an adoption of any part is an infringement of the
whole, a verdict was returned for the plaintiff. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlii_b'>xlii_b</span>suppose the merits of the case had wholly rested, as
had been expected, upon the distinction between <em>gas</em>
and <em>vapour</em>; the chemical evidence would no doubt
have urged that the one being permanently elastic and
incapable of condensation, must be considered as
very distinct in its nature from the other which admitted
of being condensed into a liquid. Under such
a conviction the plaintiff might probably have lost
his verdict. But had the same trial, under the same
circumstances, been deferred only for a few weeks,
the effect of the chemical evidence must have been
widely different, <i>Mr. Faraday</i> having, within the
last month, succeeded in condensing no less than
nine<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c011'><sup>[59]</sup></a> of these gaseous bodies that were universally
acknowledged to be permanently elastic! and thus
has this ingenious and indefatigable chemist, by a
happy generalization, annulled the supposed characteristic
distinction between <em>gas</em> and <em>vapour</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subject of forgery, and of frauds upon banker’s
checques, accomplished by the well-known agency
of acids in discharging ordinary writing, would
upon the same grounds have been considered as a legitimate
object of medical jurisprudence; and we
should have proceeded to inquire into the different
chemical means by which such frauds might be prevented.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c011'><sup>[60]</sup></a>
The subject of nuisances would also
have received a more extended notice; and we should
not have deemed it necessary to limit our observations
upon the detection of fraudulent adulteration to those
substances, the purity of which is essential to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xliii_b'>xliii_b</span>health of the community. But it is unnecessary to
multiply examples in proof of the latitude of the subject,
or of the utter impracticability of any attempt
to pursue its ramifications in the present work.</p>

<p class='c000'>In our physiological illustrations we have, upon
all occasions, sought to establish general principles
for the solution of the various problems of forensic
medicine. It has been said that “it is not so much
the knowledge of the laws of physiology, as that of
the exceptions to which they are liable, that is required
in elucidation of abstruse medico-legal questions.”
If this were admitted, the propriety of such
scientific applications might be altogether doubted.
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leges fiunt de his quæ vulgo, non de his quæ raro
eveniunt</span></i>”; but, in truth, the exceptions of Nature are
but apparent—the mere illusions arising from our
imperfect view of her phenomena; and will diminish
as our knowledge increases, just as the motions of the
heavenly bodies cease to appear irregular as soon as
their orbits are submitted to a more extended field of
observation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second volume of our work commences with a
physiological research into the “Causes and Phenomena
of Sudden Death.” To the views developed in
this chapter we are the more particularly anxious to
direct the attention of the student, as they may be said
to constitute the centre, and master-key of forensic
physiology; while the obvious importance of their
applications, in directing the treatment of asphyxia
and cases of poisoning, will convey a striking rebuke
to those who still deny the <em>practical</em> utility of such researches.
We might even extend this remark to the
more ordinary duties of the surgical practitioner, and
in support of its truth, maintain, that he can neither
fully comprehend, nor successfully treat the more important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xliv_b'>xliv_b</span>symptoms which attend injuries of the head,
without an acquaintance with those mutual relations
which subsist between the functions of the brain and
heart, and those of the organs of respiration. To an
ignorance of such views we may trace the origin of
those discordant opinions which have existed with regard
to the proper mode of treating concussion, or
compression of the brain. Some practitioners, from
having observed that the action of the heart frequently
becomes enfeebled on these occasions, have unconditionally
insisted upon the necessity of cordials;
while others, reasoning upon the state of the brain,
have with equal confidence advocated the propriety
of immediate and copious depletion by the lancet.
Let us see how far a knowledge of the physiological
doctrines to which we have alluded will reconcile
such conflicting opinions, and point out the proper
plan which ought to be pursued in such cases of difficulty.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been stated,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c011'><sup>[61]</sup></a> that the first violent impression
upon the brain, whether occasioned by an external
force, or a “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de sang</span></i>,” from hemorrhage
within the skull, will be very liable to produce syncope.
This effect, when it occurs, ought of course
to be distinguished from the more ordinary symptoms
of concussion and compression, and which may be
said to approach the nature of suffocation, rather
than that of syncope, as they depend upon impeded
respiration, from a failure in the action of the muscles
which are essential to it. In the former case it would
be highly injudicious to resort to the lancet, until the
action of the heart shall have been restored by cordials;
whereas in the latter, prompt and copious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlv_b'>xlv_b</span>blood-letting must be considered as the most effectual
of all the resources of art.</p>

<p class='c000'>For much of the novelty contained in this part of
our work, the reader will find that we are greatly
indebted to the liberality and friendship of <i>Mr. Brodie</i>,
who afforded us the assistance of his <cite>Manuscript
Notes</cite>, from which he delivered his lectures from the
anatomical chair of the College of Surgeons.</p>

<p class='c000'>With regard to the manner in which the subjects
have been individually elucidated, we may venture
to hope that, in a work of such extensive range, the
reader will scarcely expect to find every department
equally elaborate in execution; our discretion on this
point has been, in great measure, directed by the
degree of importance attached to each subject, and the
extent and nature of the popular fallacies with which
it is surrounded. In dealing with subjects thus embarrassed
we have ever deemed it a great point to
clear away every adventitious incumbrance, so as to
make a naked circle around the object in dispute, and
to afford an uninterrupted view of it on every side.
We have, therefore, in pursuance of such a principle,
endeavoured to bring the leading points of controversy
within the scope of a few prominent questions,
that we might discuss the merits of each with a share
of attention commensurate with our idea of its importance.
The advantages of such a plan will receive,
we trust, a favourable exemplification in our history
of poisons.</p>

<p class='c000'>For our numerous quotations, if any apology be
necessary, we may offer that of the learned <i>Tortosa</i>,
deeming it more expedient to incur the charge of
scholastic affectation, than to leave our readers in the
dark, as to the sources from which we have derived
our information, and particularly as we are thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlvi_b'>xlvi_b</span>enabled to furnish the student with various references
to which he may advantageously apply for more extended
information.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some writers have objected altogether to the
science of Medical Jurisprudence, alleging that it
is an unnecessary addition to the already too numerous
pursuits of the medical student; to their doctrine
we cannot assent, even though so high an
authority as a dictum of <i>Sir Wm. Blackstone</i> is adduced
in its support; the learned commentator says,
“for the gentlemen of the faculty of physic, I must
frankly own that I see no special reason why they in
particular should apply themselves to the study of the
law; unless in common with other gentlemen, and
to complete the character of general and extensive
knowledge—a character which their profession beyond
others has remarkably deserved. They will
give me leave, however, to suggest, and that not
ludicrously, that it might frequently be of use to families
upon sudden emergencies, if the physician
were acquainted with the doctrine of last wills and
testaments, at least so far as relates to the formal
part of their execution.” It is not merely our object
to show that, in common with other gentlemen,
medical practitioners should have some general
knowledge of the law, without which they cannot in
any scene of life discharge properly their duty either
to the public or themselves; but to demonstrate, that
there are many and intricate branches of law, in which
the physician or surgeon, by competent knowledge,
may not only materially serve himself in reputation,
and his patients by advice, but also render important
benefit to the community.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is true that medical practitioners, for reasons
hereafter stated, are exempt from serving on juries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlvii_b'>xlvii_b</span>and are seldom charged with magisterial duties, at least
till they have retired from the more active employment
of their profession; it must be remembered,
however, that they are charged with important and
peculiar jurisdictions; and it is impossible to look at
the various litigations which we have enumerated in
the first part of our work, without feeling that every
member of the medical colleges ought to possess some
legal knowledge. Can the President and Censors of
the College of Physicians execute their power of fine
and imprisonment; can they restrain unlicensed intruders,
or punish the bad practices of ignorant pretenders,
without some study of the law? can they
vindicate their rights without reference to the numerous
acts of parliament on which they are founded?
can they prove the guardians of the public health,
without knowing the enactments by which it is protected?
can they advise the legislative or executive
power on numerous points submitted to their consideration,
(as vaccine inoculation, quarantine, &amp;c.)
without understanding the bearings of the question
referred to them? can they in fine do or advise any
public act, without considering either the existing
law as it may stand, or the policy and mode of future
enactment? they may indeed state as much of
the medical, chemical, or physiological facts of each
case as their imperfect view may enable them to take;
leaving it to the lawyer, who knows no physic, to correct
the errors of the physician who knows no law.
That acts of parliament have been framed on this
principle of the mutual independence of law and
science, it were vain to deny; but that they would
have been better framed, if the parties employed in
drawing them up had possessed some understanding
in common on the subject before them, is equally indisputable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlviii_b'>xlviii_b</span>Let us therefore hope that, when our
reader shall have considered the many points in
which medicine and its branches may become auxiliary
to legislation or government, he will feel convinced
that legal studies are not useless to medical
practitioners in their public capacity.</p>

<p class='c000'>In considering the use of legal knowledge as applicable
to private practice, <i>Sir William Blackstone</i>
has mentioned one of many instances; it would be
useful if the medical attendant were acquainted with
at least the formal part of executing wills; in the
moment of danger and distress, when all around the
bed of death are confused with fear, or overwhelmed
in affliction, the physician, probably a confidential
friend, whose duty and habit ensures self-possession,
may be the only person competent to advise. How
many estates have been lost to the intended heir, by
the want of a third witness to a devise of real property?
or by an attestation informally signed, because
the curtains of the bed were drawn, and the testator
could not see the witnesses? From considering
the last, let us turn back and enquire whether medical
observation may not be necessary in the first scene
of life. A midwife, unacquainted with the law of
tenant by the courtesey, will scarcely note whether a
child, certainly dead within a minute of its birth, did
in that period move a limb or open an eye; he
will not consider whether a momentary quivering
of the lip was a sign of <a id='ind'></a>independent vitality, or
the expiring remains of uterine life. If after a
lapse of ten or twenty years he should be examined
in a court of justice on this point in order
to determine the right of the father to his estate for
life, he will be unable to satisfy his own conscience,
or the ends of justice; but once acquainted with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlix_b'>xlix_b</span>importance of these observations, he will never fail
to note the occurrence, whenever he has reason to
believe that the circumstances of the case may give
rise to legal question.</p>

<p class='c000'>In cases of impotence, sterility, idiotcy, and lunacy,
the confidential medical attendant is the first person
consulted on the subject; how often may he refute a
groundless accusation, remove a causeless fear, and
prevent a public exposure, by forming and demonstrating
correct views of the subject? how often too
may he aid the oppressed, defeat the guilty, and protect
the innocent, by a knowledge of the legal remedies
against fraud or coercion?</p>

<p class='c000'>In many criminal cases too the surgeon is of necessity
among the first witnesses of the deed; is it not
important that he should know what evidence will be
required to prove its perpetration? surrounded by
ignorant or prejudiced persons, his calm and accurate
view, not only of medical, but of general points, becomes
of peculiar importance; yet if he be unacquainted
with the forms of judicial enquiry, unversed
in the history of criminal courts, he will be as little
able to direct his attention to the proper objects, or to
divest his mind of undue bias, as the most ignorant of
the by-standers.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we shall have frequent occasion in the course of
this work to revert to these points, we do not now dwell
on them more minutely, than to repeat our opinion,
that a general knowledge of the law is not only becoming
to the medical practitioner in his character
of a gentleman, but highly useful and necessary to his
professional career. We do not expect that medical
students shall become special pleaders, or that the bar
shall vie in chemistry and physiology with the professors
of those sciences; but we shall endeavour to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_l_b'>l_b</span>point out to each the sources from which they may
draw information if they are desirous of acquiring it;
we are of necessity confined within narrow bounds;
but if within those limits we enable the two professions
of law and physic to understand and appreciate
each other, our object is accomplished.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>1. OF THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>It</span> does not appear that the Professors of Physic
were in any way classed, or incorporated, in England,
until the year 1522, although we learn from the
preamble of the Charter of Henry the Eighth, as well
as from the petition of the 9th of Henry the Fifth,
that other countries had long before that period
established Medical Colleges, having considered such
a measure not only as necessary for the encouragement
of science, but as highly politic for the preservation
of the public health.</p>

<p class='c000'>England, although destined to take the lead in
research and discovery at a later period, was in the
sixteenth century far behind her continental neighbours
in the field of Science. And with respect to
the study and practice of physic, it seems probable
that, until after the foundation of the College of
Physicians, it had not even assumed the character and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>dignity of a regular profession; for we find that the
very few learned men in that branch, which the annals
of the period can furnish, had acquired their knowledge
in the foreign universities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Until the auspicious period of the Reformation,
various circumstances contributed to retard the progress
of medical science; the first and most considerable
of which may be traced to the many monastic
establishments<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c011'><sup>[62]</sup></a> with which the country was infested;
the Monks are known to have practised physic
very extensively, and when the superstitious character
of these ages is considered, we shall not feel surprised
at the vulgar, and perhaps not the lower order alone,
having preferred, to every other medical assistance,
the aid of those who arrogated to themselves the
immediate assistance of heaven in the preparation
and administration of their medicines.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Alchemists<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c011'><sup>[63]</sup></a> were another, and very numerous
class to whom we may justly refer the temporary
degradation of the science of medicine. Like their
lineal descendants, the Empirics of modern times,
their attention was directed to the discovery of an
universal specific which should be equally applicable
to every disease; and as presumption is ever proportionate
to incapacity, we need not be surprised
that they should have been eagerly followed by the
ignorant of their day, as their successors are by the
vulgar of our own; under such circumstances there
could have been but little encouragement to men of
real learning, and as we find by the recital of the act
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>of 5 <i>Hen.</i> 8. c. 6. that there were but twelve regular
Surgeons practising in all London, we may safely
conclude that the number of legitimate physicians
must have been proportionally smaller. The Universities
of Oxford and Cambridge had probably
from the time of their foundation conferred degrees
in medicine, but these do not appear to have carried
with them any general privilege or authority; their
rights indeed were reserved by the concluding section
of the 3d <i>Hen.</i> 8, <i>c.</i> 11, but in what those rights consisted
has not been judicially determined, even though
the litigation to which the Act and the subsequent
Charter of the College gave rise, would naturally
have produced some decision on this point, had the
extent of those ancient rights ever been legally
defined<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c011'><sup>[64]</sup></a>. We shall not consume any farther time
upon this question, for although it might be a subject
of some antiquarian curiosity, it would furnish but
little matter of professional interest, or practical
utility. In the present age the Universities of Oxford
and Cambridge are firmly united by a communion
of sentiment and interest to the College of
Physicians, and physicians are rarely admitted as
Fellows<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c011'><sup>[65]</sup></a> of this learned body, unless they have
previously graduated in one of the English Universities,
or at Trinity College, Dublin, but even in this
latter case, it is required that the candidate for admission
should have been previously incorporated
either into the University of Cambridge or Oxford.
That a distinction founded on such a basis should
have excited an angry and jealous feeling in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>excluded party is not extraordinary; and the authors
of the present work hope that they shall stand excused
for offering a few remarks upon a subject which they
consider vitally interwoven with the best interests of
the profession. The arguments which have been so
repeatedly urged against the justice, as well as policy,
of the Bye-law<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c011'><sup>[66]</sup></a> which thus excludes all, but the
graduates of an English University, from the honours
of the Fellowship, may be easily refuted, and its
salutary tendency, in relation to the interests of the
public, as well as to the dignity of the profession,
very satisfactorily demonstrated. For the complete
knowledge of medicine, as a science, all the collateral
lights of natural philosophy and erudition,
are required; while for its successful practice as an
art, the physician should possess those high qualifications
of mind, and have received that moral cultivation
which a mere technical education can never
bestow. We are willing to admit that “the curative
art cannot be learnt on the sequestered banks of the
Cam or the Isis, as well as amid the distress and
sickness of a great city;” but we assert with equal
confidence, that the liberal pursuits, and wholesome
discipline of an English university, can best prepare
the mind for the full and extensive benefits, which
the pupil is afterwards to derive from his professional
studies in the metropolis; and if it be essential to
encourage a liberal education amongst those who are
destined to move in the higher walks of physic, we
would ask whether any plan could be derived more
likely to ensure our object, than that fair and honourable
reward which is held out by this unjustly reviled
bye-law of the College of Physicians. It has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>urged, that the education of a physician is thus
rendered materially and unnecessarily expensive;
and that the delay of twelve years, which are required
for the full completion of the highest medical degree,
proves another great and vexatious hardship;—to all
this we reply, that we should politically resist any
measure that had the least tendency to divest medical
education of its pecuniary sacrifices, and to open the
temple to a crowd of needy and half-educated adventurers.
Tissot seems to have entertained the same
sentiment, and he observes that, for these reasons, no
person ought to be allowed to study physic in his
native city: the operation of this bye-law will therefore
furnish the surest guarantee of professional respectability,
and the College of Physicians will
continue to enroll names distinguished for science
and erudition, men who will cast a lustre on the profession,
over which they preside: let then the practitioner
in medicine beware how he attempts to depreciate
the dignity and importance of this ancient institution,
or to deny the rights and privileges to which
the corporate body is legally and morally entitled, for
to the College of Physicians, as it regards the whole
profession of physic, we may address the same emphatic
words that Cicero applied to Torquatus with
reference to the state, “<span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tibi, nullum periculum
esse perspicio, quod quidem sejunctum sit ab
omnium interitu</span></span>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor is the College singular or invidious, as may
at first sight appear, in adopting this rule; by far the
greater number, if not all, of the Bishops require a
similar qualification for the Church; and the Inns of
Court, though they do not exclude others, grant some
indulgence to members of the University on entering
their respective societies, and remit two years of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>usual term of probation to those who have taken the
degree of Master of Arts or Bachelor of Laws previously
to their call to the Bar.</p>

<p class='c000'>The College of Physicians in London owes its foundation
to <i>Dr. Thomas Linacre</i> of All Soul’s, Oxford,
one of the physicians to king <i>Henry</i> the 8th, a man
of profound learning and most devotedly attached to
his profession; having studied at Rome, Bologna,
and Florence, (then under the government of <i>Lorenzo
de Medici</i>, by whom he was encouraged), he naturally
imbibed an admiration of the medical schools with
which Italy then abounded, and appears to have distinguished
himself so much both by his general learning
and particular science that he was called to Court
as physician to the king, and entrusted by <i>Henry</i> the
7th both with the health and education of his son
prince <i>Arthur</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The practice of Medicine was about that time, as
we have before observed, chiefly engrossed by empirics
and monks, who, and especially the latter, easily
obtained licences from the bishops in their several dioceses,
to whom was committed the authority of examining
practitioners in an art of which they could
not be competent judges. <i>Linacre</i>, through his interest
with Cardinal Wolsey, a man most highly and
honorably distinguished for his munificent encouragement
of learning, obtained in 1518 Letters Patent
(<i>see Appendix</i>, p. 5,) from <i>Henry</i> the 8th,<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c011'><sup>[67]</sup></a>, constituting
a Corporate Body of regular Physicians in
London, with peculiar privileges hereafter to be specified.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span><i>Linacre</i><a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c011'><sup>[68]</sup></a> (though his name is second in the
Letters Patent) was elected the first President of the
College, which held its meetings at his house in Knight
Rider Street; he was continued in the office during
his life, and bequeathed his house to the College at
his death; he was distinguished both by his learning
and his friendship with learned men, among whom he
enjoyed the commendations of <i>Erasmus</i> and <i>Melancthon</i>.
He died in 1524, in the sixty-fourth year of
his age, and was buried in St. Paul’s, where a monument
was erected to his memory by <i>Dr. Caius</i>, one of
the most learned and munificent of his successors.
<i>See Preface to Goodall’s Proceedings of the College:
Biog. Britan.: Aikin’s Biog. Mem. of Medicine</i>: &amp;
6 <cite>Aikin’s General Biography</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it cannot be uninteresting to trace the progress
of a society through the medium of its principal ornaments,
and as the authors owe to <i>Dr. Caius</i> the foundation
of that institution in which they commenced
those joint chemical studies which have indirectly induced
their present undertaking, they do not apologize
to the reader for adding a short notice of his
life, and of that of <i>Dr. Harvey</i>, another considerable
benefactor to the College of Physicians.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. John Caius</i>, <i>Kaye</i>, or <i>Key</i>, of Gonville-hall,
Cambridge, succeeded <i>Linacre</i> in the Presidency; like
him he had travelled in Italy for his improvement in
the study of Medicine, and having resided in Padua
and Bologna, where he took his Doctor’s degree, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>was for some years Greek lecturer, he pursued his
travels through Germany and France. After his return
to England, he was called to Court as Physician
to king <i>Edward</i> the 6th; in 1547 he was made a Fellow
of the College of Physicians, the rights and privileges
of which he most strenuously asserted and
augmented. In 1557 and 1558 he obtained from
queen <i>Mary</i>, with whom he was a favourite, a licence
to advance Gonville-hall into a College, under the
name of <i>Gonville &amp; Caius College</i>, on the condition
of enlarging the institution at his own expense. Of
this college he accepted the mastership in 1569, and
in order that he might devote his undivided attention
to his favourite project, he resigned the Presidency of
the College of Physicians in 1565, and completed his
new buildings at Cambridge in 1570, at an expense
which was very considerable in those days. The mansion
of learning, thus raised by his liberality, became
the retreat of his old age, and having resigned the
mastership, with a disinterestedness equalled only by
his munificence, he continued to reside as a Fellow
Commoner until the period of his death, which happened
in 1573, in the sixty-third year of his age.
The laconic epitaph on his monument in Caius College
Chapel, <span class='sc'>Fui Caius</span>, is well known. For an
account of his many learned works <cite>see Aikin’s Biog.
Memoirs of Medicine: 2 Aikin’s General Biog.</cite> and
<cite>Goodall’s Proceedings of the College</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. William Harvey</i>, of Gonville and Caius College,
Cambridge, to whom we are indebted for the
important discovery of the circulation of the blood,
was another ornament and benefactor of the College.
Like his predecessors he visited France, Germany, and
Italy, in order to perfect himself in the science of
Medicine; at Padua he studied under the most celebrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Professors of that University, then at the
height of its reputation, and in the anatomical school
of <i>Fabricius</i> caught the first idea of his great discovery,
by attributing their true office to the valves
of the veins, exhibited, but not explained, by his
master. From this circumstance, the envious of his
own time and some foreigners to this day, have attempted
to deprive our countryman of the honor of
his invention<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c011'><sup>[69]</sup></a>. In 1602 <i>Harvey</i> took his Doctor’s
degree at Padua, shortly after which he graduated at
Cambridge; in 1616 or 1619 he published his discovery
in his Lectures before the College, and like
many others suffered in his practice from the reputation
of his learning, for men would not then believe
that the labours of the closet and dissecting-room
were the truest roads to professional skill.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was however appointed Physician extraordinary
to <i>James</i>, and subsequently Physician in ordinary to
king <i>Charles</i> the 1st; by the latter he was highly esteemed
and favoured, having been appointed during
the residence of the king at Oxford to the Mastership
of Merton College, vacant by the secession of the
Warden, <i>Dr. Brent</i>, to the Parliamentary party; this
appointment however, he did not hold long, being in
turn displaced by his predecessor.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Some time about 1652, the College having removed
from their ancient house in Knight Rider Street to
one at Amen Corner, <i>Dr. Harvey</i> built them a library
and public hall, which he granted for ever to the College,
with his library and a valuable collection of instruments.
<cite>See 1 Stowe’s London</cite>, 131.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1654 <i>Harvey</i> was unanimously elected President
of the College of Physicians, but he excused himself
on account of his age and infirmities; such however
was his attachment to that body, best evinced by <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">donationes
inter vivos</span></i>, that in 1656 he made over his personal
estate in perpetuity for its use. He died in
1658, in the eightieth year of his age; his works were
published by the College in 1766, in quarto, to which
edition his life is prefixed, to which we refer, as also
to <cite>Aikin’s Biog. Mem. of Med.</cite>; <cite>Halleri Bibl. Anat.</cite>;
<cite>Aikin’s Gen. Biog.</cite> and the <cite>Preface to Goodall’s Proceedings</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>We should exceed our limits and wander from our
purpose if we entered more fully into the biography
of the many celebrated men who have since graced
the College<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c011'><sup>[70]</sup></a>; it is enough for us to have directed
the reader’s attention by the preceding memoirs to
the very rapid improvement which the science of
Physic appears to have undergone immediately after
its institution. The profession gained much in respectability
by their incorporation, which afforded a
unity of interest among its legitimate professors, at
the same time that it armed them with extraordinary
powers against their opponents: it also gave additional
means to the learned of mutually communicating their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>researches and discoveries, at a time when the comparative
scarcity of printed books rendered such
intercourse doubly valuable. The dissolution of the
monasteries, and the consequent dispersion of a host
of ecclesiastical empirics, with the destruction of their
prejudices and superstitions, as inconsistent with the
progress of liberal science, as degrading to religious
principle, completed the triumph which the foundation
of the College had begun. The consequence is
evident. England, which in the beginning of the
sixteenth century had been behind all the then civilized
world in medical knowledge, finds herself in the
commencement of the nineteenth inferior to none in
any branch, superior to most in some, and taking a decided
lead in all the ramifications into which the science
of physic and the sister arts have divided themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>This effect however was not produced by the College,
without some severe struggles on the part of
those who were, or supposed themselves to be, aggrieved
by the extraordinary powers granted to the
Corporation by the Charter of <i>Henry</i> the 8th; it does
not appear whether any of these disputes arose between
the granting of the Letters Patent and their
confirmation by the statute 14 and 15 <i>Hen.</i> 8. <i>c.</i> 5.
at least no cases remain recorded by any sufficient
authorities; it is therefore probable that the College
did not attempt any exercise of their new powers
until they had received the sanction of Parliament;
even the king, (and no one will suspect <i>Henry</i> the
8th of any diffidence of royal prerogative) by using
the terms “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quantum in nobis est</span></i>,” (see Charter)
seems to have been conscious that the powers of fine
and imprisonment which he professed to grant, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">suo
jure</span></i>, could only become effective by the ratification of
a superior authority.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The restriction of practice to persons examined and
licenced by some supposed competent authority was
not new. Sir <i>Wm. Brown</i> in his Vindication of the
College from the imputation and misrepresentation of
their adversary in the case of Dr. <i>Schomberg</i>, mentions
an Act of Parliament or Ordinance of the 9th
<i>Hen.</i> 5. (<i>see Appendix</i>, <i>p.</i> 1.) by which the licencing
of physicians is confined to the Universities, and of
surgeons to persons duly qualified: and the 3d <i>Hen.</i>
8. c. 11. (<i>see Appendix</i>, <i>p.</i> 3.) somewhat strangely
confers on the Bishop of London, and in his absence
on the Dean of St. Paul’s, the exclusive power or
privilege of licencing physicians and surgeons in the
City of London, and within seven miles in compass.
It can scarcely be doubted that the provisions of this
act as relating to physicians, were <a id='rep'></a>repealed by the
Act 14 and 15 <i>Hen.</i> 8. <i>c.</i> 5. confirming the incorporation
of the College, for where a power to do a
specific thing is given to two distinct persons or
bodies by separate Acts, it is a general rule that the
last repeals the former, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quia Leges posteriores Leges
priores contrarias abrogant</span></i>; yet it is said that a Bishop
of London has within a few years professed to grant
a licence to practise physic in London and within
seven miles thereof. Now, independent of the objection
before mentioned, it is evident, even on the construction
of the 3. <i>Hen.</i> 8. <i>c.</i> 11. from which alone the
power is derivable, that such licence, if any such were
granted, is bad; for the words of the statute are,
“calling to him or them (the Bishop and Dean) four
Doctors of Physick, and for Surgery other expert
Persons in that Faculty, and for the first Examination
such as they shall think convenient, and
<em>afterward alway four of them that have been so
approved</em>:” Now if the Bishop cannot find four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>assessors <em>so approved</em>, his authority must cease, for he
cannot exercise it without them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The power of the Archbishop of Canterbury<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c011'><sup>[71]</sup></a> to
confer degrees of all kinds (a relic of Papal usurpation
transferred to him by statute 25 <i>Hen.</i> 8. <i>c.</i> 21)
has induced a belief that the Archbishop has a power
of granting licences to practise physic, and several
have been granted accordingly; among others
<i>Wm. Lilly</i>, the astrologer, was licenced to practise
physic, except in London and within seven miles; for
his diploma, the wording of which is curious, <i>see
the Appendix</i>. Now though the Pope may have
had the power of granting degrees and licences in
physic, the concluding words of the 14th and 15th
<i>Hen.</i> 8. confirmed by 1st <i>Mary</i>, are sufficient to exclude
the authority either of the Pope or of the Archbishop,
“that no person from henceforth be suffered
to exercise or practise in Physic through all England
until such time as he be examined at London
by the said President and three of the said Elects,
and to have from the said President or Elects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Letters Testimonials of their approving and examination,
except he be a Graduate of Oxford or
Cambridge, which hath accomplished all things for
his Form without any Grace.” Then as it cannot
be pretended that the Archbishop’s licentiate, though
he may be a graduate of Oxford or Cambridge, is one
who has accomplished all things for his form (<i>subaudi</i>
in physic) without any grace, it follows that such
degree or licence is void as respects the authority of
the College of Physicians.</p>

<p class='c000'>The provisions of the Act of the 3d <i>Hen.</i> 8. could
produce no permanent benefit, and we therefore find
within seven years, that the continuance of the abuses
which it was intended to remedy, was made the
foundation of granting its powers to a Corporation
better calculated to exercise them; what these
powers are we must now investigate somewhat minutely,
for it is an essential branch of Medical Jurisprudence
to regulate and define the privileges and
office of those who are best able to give effect to its
institutions.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be necessary to premise that though several
subsequent Charters<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c011'><sup>[72]</sup></a> have been prepared for or
offered to the acceptance of the College of Physicians
(as 15 <i>James</i> and 15 <i>Charles</i> 2. for which <i>see</i> Sir <i>Wm.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span><i>Brown’s</i> Vindication, Dr. <i>Chas. Goodall’s</i> Collection,
and other works, most of which are enumerated in
<i>Gough’s</i> Topography of London), yet the Charter and
Statute of <i>Henry</i> the 8th is still the subsisting ground
of the rights, privileges, and powers of the Corporation.
By their Charter recited in, and confirmed
by the 14th and 15th <i>Hen.</i> 8. (<i>see Appendix</i>, <i>p.</i> 7)
<i>John Chambre</i>, <i>Thomas Linacre</i>, <i>Ferdinando de
Victoria</i>,<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c011'><sup>[73]</sup></a> physicians to the king, and <i>Nicholas
Halsewel</i>, <i>John Francis</i>, and <i>Robert Yaxley</i>, physicians,
and the rest of the faculty in and of London,
are constituted a perpetual college or community,
with power annually to choose a President, who is to
govern and superintend the College, and all men of
the faculty and their practice (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnes homines ejusdem
facultatis et negotia eorundem</span></i>,) they are to have perpetual
succession and a common seal, with power to
hold lands to an amount therein limited (but which
has since been enlarged by other Charters) notwithstanding
the statute of Mortmain. They may sue and
be sued by the name of the President and College or
Community of the Faculty of Physic in London (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per
nomina Presidentis et collegii seu communitatis facultatis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>medicinæ Lond’</span></i>); they may hold meetings (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">congregationes
licitas et honestas</span></i>) and make bye-laws (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">stat’ et
ordinationes</span></i>) for the good government, superintendance,
and correction (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro salubri gubernatione, supervisu,
et correctione</span></i>) not only of the College but of all
persons exercising the faculty in the city, or within
seven miles thereof, (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnium hominum eandem facultatem
in dicta civitate seu per septem miliaria in
circuitu ejusdem civitatis exercen’</span></i>). And it was granted
to the College that none should exercise the
faculty of physic within the city, or seven miles
thereof, unless they had been admitted by the President
and College by letters under their common seal,
under the penalty of five pounds (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">centum solidorum</span></i>)
for every month during which such unlicenced person
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non admissus</span></i>) should practice; one half of the said
penalty to the King, and one half to the President
and College. The Charter further directs that the
President and College should every year elect four
(censors) who should have the superintendance, correction,
and government of all persons exercising the
faculty of medicine in any manner (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliquo modo frequentantium
et utentium</span></i>) in the city, or within seven
miles thereof; with powers to punish for mal-practice
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ac punitionem eorund’ pro delictis suis in non bene
exequendo, faciendo, et utendo illa</span></i>) and with power
of superintendance and scrutiny of all medicines and
their administration, provided that the punishment
should be by fines, amercements, imprisonment, and
other reasonable modes (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per fines, amerciamenta, &amp;
imprisonamenta, corpor’ suor’ et per alias vias rationab’
et congruas</span></i>.) The Charter then directs (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quantum in
nobis est</span></i>) that the president and fellows of the College,
and their successors, should be exempt from
and should not be summoned to Assizes, Juries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Inquests, Attaints, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et aliis recognitionibus</span></i>, by the
Mayor, Sheriffs, or Coroners of the City, even by the
king’s writ. It was provided however by the concluding
clause that nothing contained in the Charter
should prejudice the City of London.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the recital of the Charter the Statute proceeds
to confirm the same “in as ample and large manner
as may be taken, thought, and construed,” and
directs the election of eight elects, from among whom
the president is to be annually chosen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The concluding section of this act is important, as
it evidently repeals so much of the 3 <i>H.</i> 8. as refers
to physicians, enacting, “that no person from henceforth
be suffered to exercise or practise in physic
through <i>England</i><a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c011'><sup>[74]</sup></a> until such time as he be examined
at London, by the said President and Three
of the said Elects; and to have from the said President
or Elects Letters Testimonials of their approving
and examination, except he be a Graduate of
Oxford or Cambridge, which hath accomplished
all Things for his Form without any Grace.”<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c011'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>The next Act which concerns the College is the
32d <i>Hen.</i> 8. <i>c.</i> 40. (<i>see Appendix, p.</i> 14) by which it
is enacted that the President, Fellows, and Commons
of the College, should be discharged from keeping
Watch and Ward in the City or its Suburbs, and that
they shall not be chosen to the office of Constable, or
to any other office in the City or Suburbs, any Order,
Custom, or Law, to the contrary notwithstanding;
By the second section of this Act the power and office
of the Censors, which had been left somewhat undefined
by the 14 &amp; 15 <i>Hen.</i> 8. is more accurately
and fully determined. They are empowered to enter
the houses of all Apothecaries in the City, for the
purpose <em>only</em> of searching and viewing their wares,
drugs, and stuffs, and if any be found defective or
corrupted, they may cause them to be burnt, or otherwise
destroyed, and a penalty of five pounds,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c011'><sup>[76]</sup></a> to be
recovered by any that will sue for it, is inflicted on
apothecaries who obstinately or willingly refuse or
deny the four Censors to enter into their houses; a
penalty of forty shillings is also inflicted on any
Censor, who being elected, shall refuse the oath
directed to be taken, or neglect the execution of his
office. The oath of the censor, is by this act, directed
to be administered by the President of the College.
The censors are also obliged to take the oaths of
allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration in the Court
of Exchequer at Westminster, hence the impropriety,
if not illegality, of any Papist or Recusant being
elected a Fellow of the College.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>By the third and concluding section it is declared,
that “forasmuch as the Science of Physick, doth
comprehend and contain the knowledge of Surgery,”
“any of the said Company or Fellowship of Physicians,
being able, chosen, and admitted, by the said
President and Fellowship of Physicians,” may practice
the Science of Physic in all its members, both in
London and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Statute 34 and 35 <i>Hen.</i> 8. <i>c.</i> 8, entitled “A Bill
that Persons being no common Surgeons, may
minister medicines, notwithstanding the Statute,”
refers to the 3d <i>H.</i> 8. <i>c.</i> 11. omitting all mention of
the subsequent acts of the 14th, 15th and 32d,
which were for the regulation of the Physicians of
London, and as this Statute appears to have been
directed against the then Surgeons of London, and for
the relief of charitable persons, who had ministered
to poor people, not taking any thing for their pains
and cunning in certain diseases,<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c011'><sup>[77]</sup></a> principally outward,
and therefore (in its limited sense) objects of
surgery rather than medicine; we shall treat of this
act more at large when we enter upon the Charters
and Statutes relating to the College of Surgeons.
By this act, however, inward medicines are permitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>to be administered by persons having knowledge and
experience of the nature of herbs, roots and waters,
for the stone, strangury or agues.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c011'><sup>[78]</sup></a> The latter
clearly do not come within the description of what
would now be called Surgical cases, and therefore
so far the exclusive privileges of the physicians are
affected by this Statute, yet it appears by the context
and interpretation of the act, (<cite>See Butler v. Coll. of
Phys.</cite>) that such administration must be of herbs,
roots or waters only, to poor persons, (<cite>R. Litt. 351,</cite>)
and without fee or reward.</p>

<p class='c000'>The acts of <i>Henry the 8th</i> having been found
insufficient in their provisions for the search of apothecaries
wares, and other matters, the Statute 1st
<i>Mary</i>, <i>sess.</i> 2. c. 9, (<i>See Appx. p.</i> 25,) was enacted,
whereby the 14th and 15th <i>Hen.</i> 8. <i>c.</i> 5, is confirmed
and declared to be in full force, any Act, Statute,
Law, Custom, or other thing made to the contrary
notwithstanding; it was further enacted, that whensoever
the President of the College, or such (the
Censors) as the President and College shall yearly
authorise to search, examine, correct, and punish, all
offenders and transgressors in the said faculty, within
the said city and precinct, shall commit any such
offender to prison, (the Tower of London excepted),
the warden or <a id='gao'></a>gaoler of such prison is to receive
and keep such person or persons at the charges of
such person or persons, till discharged by the President
and such persons as by the said College shall be
authorised; under penalty of double the fine<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c011'><sup>[79]</sup></a>
such offender be assessed to pay, so that the same
fine do not exceed twenty pounds. By the fifth
section, it is provided, that it shall be lawful for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>wardens of the grocers (now apothecaries) company,
or one of them, to go with the Physicians in their
search and view of apothecaries wares; but if the
wardens refuse or delay to come, the Physicians may
proceed without them; and the penalty of resisting
such search is raised to ten pounds; By the concluding
section, all Justices, Mayors, Sheriffs, Bailiffs, Constables,
and other ministers and officers, shall assist
the execution of the said acts, upon pain of running
in contempt of her majesty.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c011'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>By these acts of Parliament, the College of Physicians
is regulated to the present day; we have before
stated that several Charters, some for limited and
some for general purposes, have been granted to the
College. In 1520, Queen <i>Elizabeth</i> granted by
letters patent the bodies of four malefactors who had
been executed for felony, to be taken by the College
every year for dissection.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c011'><sup>[81]</sup></a> Charles the second
granted six more “provided they be afterwards
buried.” Charter 15 <i>Char.</i> 2. <i>Goodall’s</i> Coll. p.
62. This privilege we believe has not lately been
claimed, though the present scarcity of bodies for the
purposes of instruction would fully justify its revival:
nor is there any doubt but that the judges in the
exercise of their sound discretion might select some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>of the more atrocious criminals as proper objects for
this additional severity.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1562 <i>King James</i>, by letters patent, granted to
the College, for the sum of six pounds a year, that
moiety of the fines to be inflicted by them to which
the crown was entitled according to the several acts
which we have before cited. Charter 15 <i>Ja. Goodall’s</i>
Coll. p. 37.</p>

<p class='c000'>We do not think it necessary to trouble the reader
with the Statutes and Bye Law<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c011'><sup>[82]</sup></a> which the College
have made for their own internal Government, pursuant
to the power which all Corporations have of
making proper regulations to bind their own members,
and according to the Statute 14 <i>and</i> 15 <i>Hen.</i> 8. by
which they are specially authorised so to do; these
Statutes have been printed, though not under the
sanction of the College.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>OF THE POWERS OF THE COLLEGE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>One of the first and most material of the powers
and privileges granted to the College by the Acts
and Charter to which we have referred (and which
the reader will find recited in the Appendix,) is that
of recovering from all persons who practise physic in
London and within seven miles circuit, without their
Licence, or Admission, the sum of five pounds for
every month during which they have so practised.
This power has been most minutely investigated and
determined in the case of <i>Dr. Bonham</i>.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c011'><sup>[83]</sup></a> <i>Coke’s
Reports</i>, 123, (<i>see Appendix</i>, p. 62,) which was an
action of false imprisonment brought by <i>Thomas
Bonham</i>, a Doctor of Physic, of the University of
Cambridge,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c011'><sup>[84]</sup></a> against the then President, Censors
and some servants of the College; the Defendants
justified under the Statute, (14 and 15 H. 8.) setting
forth; that the plaintiff practised physic in London,
and within seven miles circuit, not being admitted, &amp;c.
that being examined he was found insufficient, and
forbid to practise,<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c011'><sup>[85]</sup></a> but notwithstanding such prohibition,
he afterwards practised for a month or more,
whereupon they amerced him five pounds, to be paid
to them at their next assembly, &amp;c.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c011'><sup>[86]</sup></a> and likewise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>injoined him to forbear practising any more until he
be found sufficient, &amp;c. upon pain of imprisonment;
that he continuing still to practise was further fined
and ordered to be committed; that being questioned
if he would submit to the College, he replied, that he
had practised and would practise without leave of the
College, and denied that by the Statute they had any
authority over him, as having taken his degree of
Doctor of Physic within the University regularly, and
so thought himself protected by that Clause in the Act;
whereupon the Censors ordered him to prison, which
was executed accordingly, and for this imprisonment
this action was brought. In this case, Mr. <i>Justice
Daniel</i>, thought a Doctor of Physic of either University
was not within the body of the act, but suppose him
to be within the body, yet he was excepted by the
last clause. But <i>Mr. Justice Warburton</i> held the
contrary upon both points.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c011'><sup>[87]</sup></a> <i>Chief Justice Coke</i>,
(for whose judgment, <i>see Appendix</i>, 26,) said nothing
as to either of those points, because all three (who
were all the judges present,) agreed, that this action
was clearly maintainable for two other points; and
they resolved,</p>

<p class='c000'>1. That the Censors had no power to commit the
Plaintiff for any of the causes mentioned in the Bar,
because the said clause which gives power to the
said Censors to fine and imprison, does not extend to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the said clause, viz. <em>That none in the said City, &amp;c.
exercise the said faculty</em>, &amp;c. which prohibits every
one from practising Physic in London, &amp;c. without
licence of the President and College; but extends
only to punish those who practise in London, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro
delictis suis in non bene exequendo faciendo et utendo
Facultate Medicinæ</span></i>, so that their power (of fine and
imprisonment) is limited to the ill and not to the
good use and practice.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c011'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>2. Admitting that the Censors had power, yet they
have not pursued it. 1. Because the Censors alone
have power to fine and imprison, whereas here the
President and Censors imposed this fine of five
pounds. 2. The plaintiff was summoned to appear
before the President and Censors, and for not appearing
was fined five pounds, whereas the President had
no authority.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. The fines imposed by them by virtue of this act
belong to the king and not to them,<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c011'><sup>[89]</sup></a> and yet the
fine is limited to be paid to themselves, &amp;c. and for
nonpayment they have imprisoned him.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. They ought to have committed the Plaintiff
immediately, though no time be limited in this act.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Their proceedings ought not to be by parol,
inasmuch as their authority is by patent and act of
parliament, and especially it being to fine and imprison.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. The Act giving a power to imprison until he be
delivered by the President and Censors or their successors,
shall be taken strictly, or otherwise the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>liberty of the subject is at their pleasure. And this
is well proved by a judgment in Parliament in the
same case; for when this act of 14. <i>Hen.</i> 8. had
given the Censors power to imprison, yet it was taken
so literally, that the gaoler was not bound to receive
such as they should commit to him, because they had
authority to imprison without any Court; and thereupon
the Statute 1 <i>Mary</i>, <i>cap.</i> 9, was made to compel
the gaoler to receive them under a penalty, and yet
none can commit to prison unless the gaoler receives
him; but the 14 <i>Hen.</i> 8, was taken so literally that
no necessary incident was implied.</p>

<p class='c000'>And it being objected, the 1 <i>Mar. Cap.</i> 9. had
enlarged the power of the Censors, as appeared by
the words of the act; it was clearly resolved, that
it does not enlarge their power to fine and imprison
for any matter not within the 14th <i>Hen.</i> 8. the words
of the act of <i>Queen Mary</i>, being “<em>according to the
tenor and meaning of the said act</em>.” And further,
“<em>shall commit any offender, &amp;c. for his, &amp;c. offence or
disobedience, contrary to any article or clause contained
in the said grant or act to any ward, gaol, &amp;c.</em>”
And in this case, it does not appear by the record,
that the plaintiff has done any thing contrary to any
article or clause within the grant or act of 14th <i>Hen.</i>
8. and for the two last points judgment was given for
the plaintiff, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nullo contradicente</span></i> as to them. <i>Michss.
Term.</i> 6 <i>James.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>The Lord <i>Chief Justice</i>, <i>Sir Edward Coke</i>, in the
conclusion of his argument, observes these seven
rules for the better direction of the President and
Commonalty of the said College for the future.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. That none can be punished for practising Physic
within London, but by forfeiture of five pounds a
month, which is to be recovered by law.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>2. If any practise Physic there for less time than a
month that he shall forfeit nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. If any person, prohibited by the Statute, offend
in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non bene exequendo, &amp;c.</span></i> they may punish him
according to the Statute within the month.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Those whom they commit to prison by the
Statute ought to be committed immediately.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. The fines which they assess according to the
Statute belong to the king.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. They cannot impose fine or imprisonment without
making a record thereof.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. The cause for which they impose a fine and
imprisonment ought to be certain, for this is traversable.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c011'><sup>[90]</sup></a>
For though they have Letters Patents
and an Act of Parliament, yet inasmuch as the party
grieved has no other remedy, neither by writ of
error or otherwise, and they are not made judges,
nor a court given to them, but have authority only
to do it, the cause of their commitment is traversable
in action of false imprisonment brought against them.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Chief Justice Holt</i>, in delivering the opinion of
the Court, said that notwithstanding the opinion in
<i>Dr. Bonham’s</i> case, the charge of male administration
of physic is not traversable, and that my <i>Lord Coke’s</i>
opinion in that case was but <i>Obiter</i>, and no judicial
opinion: besides that he seemed to have been under
some transport, because <i>Dr. Bonham</i> was a graduate
of Cambridge, his own mother university. And he
himself after in the same case says, that if the Censors
do convict a man for such offence, they ought to
make a record of it; and that, they cannot do unless
they are Judges of Record: and then we say their
proceedings are untraversable, and they unpunishable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>for what they do as judges. 12 <i>Mod.</i> 388. <i>Pasc.</i>
12 <i>Will.</i> 3. in the case of <i>Doctor Grenville against
the College of Physicians</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>That Graduates of the two Universities have no
privilege to practise in London, and within seven
miles circuit,<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c011'><sup>[91]</sup></a> has been repeatedly decided; see
Doctor <i>Levet’s</i> case, Lord <i>Raymond’s Rep.</i> 472;
<i>The Coll. of Physicians against West 10, Modd 353
and Appx.</i> That by Graduates is meant Graduates
in Physic only. <i>See College Questions. Appx.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>The case of <i>Doctor Bonham</i>,<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c011'><sup>[92]</sup></a> which we have
been the more particular in citing as it contains much
learning on the subject of our enquiries, and is
reported by the first authority of his time, having
shown that the College cannot fine or imprison for
unlicenced practice, but must proceed by action in
the ordinary Courts for the statutable penalty of five
pounds a month, we must next show by what name
the College ought to sue, for upon this point much
difference of opinion and practice appears to have
prevailed. In the case of <i>The President and College
of Physicians v. Talbois</i>, exceptions were taken that
the action should be by the President alone. But
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per curiam</span></i>, “being a Corporation, it is natural for
them to sue by their name of creation.” 1 <i>Lord
Raymond</i>, p. 153. <i>Hil. Term</i> 8 &amp; 9, <i>Will.</i> 3. See
also <i>The President and College of Physicians v.
Salmon</i>, B. R. <i>Trin. Term</i> 13 <i>Will.</i> 3. 1. <i>Ld. Raym</i>,
p. 680; 5 <i>Mod.</i> 327; and this appears to be the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>rule. In the previous case of <i>The President of the
College v. Tenant. Hill. Term.</i> 11 <i>James</i>, <i>Bulstrode’s
Rep. Part.</i> 2, <i>p.</i> 185, the action was brought by
the President alone, on which the Judges were divided
in opinion, <i>Haughton</i> Justice saying, “he may here
well bring the action alone in his own name,” but
the Declaration being bad in other respects, the rule
of the Court was, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quod querens nil capiat per Billam</span></i>.
The Entry in <i>Rastal</i>, <i>p.</i> 426, is in favour of the
doctrine that the President may sue alone, as is also
the case of Doctor <i>Laughton v. Gardner</i>, 4 <i>Croke</i>,
<i>p.</i> 121. <i>Trin. Term.</i> 4 <i>James</i>, and more especially
the consequent case of Doctor <i>Atkins v. Gardner</i>,
2 <i>Croke</i>, 169 <i>Pasc</i> 5 <i>James</i>, where Dr. <i>Laughton</i>
having brought an action of debt on the Statute, as
President of the College obtained judgment <i>Nisi</i>,
but dying before execution, his successor <i>Doctor
Atkins</i>, brought a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scire facias</span></i> against the defendant
to have execution, it was therefore demurred because
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scire facias</span></i> ought to be brought by the executor
or administrator of him who recovered and not by
his successor; but the Court held that the successor
might well maintain the action, for the suit is given
to the College by a private Statute, and the suit is
to be brought by the President for the time being,
and he having recovered in right of the Corporation,
the law shall transfer that duty to the successor of
him who recovered and not to his executors. 1 <i>Rolle
Abr.</i> 515.</p>

<p class='c000'>The penalties are to be recovered by action of
debt in <i>the President and College v. Salmon</i>; I <i>Ld.</i>
<i>Raym</i>, <i>p.</i> 680.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c011'><sup>[93]</sup></a> an exception was taken that the
proceeding should be by information at the suit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>the king, but the Court decided that where a certain
penalty is given by a statute the person to whom, &amp;c.
shall have debt by construction of law. Another
exception was taken in the same case, that the action
ought not to be brought <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tam quam</span></i>, no action being
given to the king. <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sed non allocatur.</span></i> For <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per curiam</span></i>,
the precedents are the one way and the other. See
<i>Butler v the President Cro. Car.</i> 256. and cases there
cited.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c011'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The words of the Statute of <i>Henry</i> being strongly
prohibitory, none may practise physic under any
authority, in London and within seven miles without
licence of the College; in <i>the College of Physicians
v. Bush.</i> 4 <i>Mod.</i> <i>p.</i> 47. the defendant pleaded letters
patents of king Charles the second, by which free
liberty is given to French protestants to exercise the
faculty of Physic in London and Westminster, &amp;c.
and that he was a French protestant. Upon demurrer
the plea was held ill. For a Charter or Letters
Patent cannot vary an act of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next material point to be considered is, what
is a practising of Physic within the meaning of the
statutes; this would at first sight appear to be a very
simple question, but the act of the 34th <i>Hen.</i> 8.
which gives liberty to persons not being Surgeons,
to administer outward medicines in certain cases, and
drinks for the Stone, Strangury, and Ague, created
some difficulties; it was pleaded in the case of Doctor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span><i>Butler against the President of the College</i>, (<i>Cro. Car.</i>
256,) to which plea the President replied by showing
the Statute of the 1 <i>Mary</i>, <i>c.</i> 9. which confirms the
Charter and Statute of the 14th <i>Hen.</i> 8. and appoints
that it shall be in force notwithstanding any Statute or
Ordinance to the contrary; on this several questions
arose; those which relate to the special pleading of
the case we omit, but the interpretation of the
Statutes is material; it was doubted first whether the
34th <i>Hen.</i> 8. did repeal any part of the 14th as to
Physicians, or whether as the preamble recites, it was
directed against Surgeons, and next whether if it
were in any degree repealed, the Statute 1st <i>Mary</i>
did not revive the 14th and repeal the 34th. “<i>Richardson</i>,
chief Justice, conceived it was repealed by
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primo Mariæ</span></i>, by the general words, any act or
Statute to the contrary, of the act of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">decimo quarto
Henrici Octavi</span></i>, notwithstanding. But I (“<i>loquitur
Croke</i>,”) conceived that the act of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tricessimo quarto
Henrici Octavi</span></i>, not mentioning the Statute of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">decimo
quarto Henrici Octavi</span></i>, was for Physicians; but the
part of the act of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tricessimo quarto Henrici octavi</span></i>,
was concerning Chirurgions and their applying
outward medicines to outward sores and diseases,
and drinks only for the Stone, Strangury and Ague;
that Statute was never intended to be taken away
by <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">primo Mariæ</span></i>. But to this point, <i>Jones</i> and
<i>Whitlock</i>, would not deliver their opinions; but
admitting the Statute 34 <i>Hen.</i> 8. be in force, yet
they all resolved, the <a id='def'></a>defendant’s<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c011'><sup>[95]</sup></a> plea was
naught, and not warranted by the Statute;
for he pleads, that he applied and ministered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>medicines, plaisters, drinks, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ulceribus Morbis et
Maladiis, Calculo Strangurio, Febribus et aliis in
Statuto mentionatis</span></i>; so he leaves out the principal
word in the Statute (<i>Externis</i>), and doth not refer
and shew that he ministered potions for the Stone,
Strangulation or Ague, as the Statute appoints to
these three diseases only and to no other; and by
his plea his potions may be ministered to any other
sickness; wherefore they all held his plea was
naught for this cause, and that judgment was
well given against him; whereupon judgment was
affirmed.” This case is reported more fully in
<i>Brownlow</i>, p. 126. See also <i>Goodall</i>, p. 221 to p. 259.</p>

<p class='c000'>But though this statute 34 <i>Hen.</i> 8th gave a very
considerable latitude to unlicensed practice, the decision
of the House of Lords in the case of <i>Rose</i> has
rendered it yet more difficult to determine what is a
practising of Physic within the statute 14 <i>Hen.</i> 8th.</p>

<p class='c000'>This case arose on an action in the King’s Bench
for practising Physic within seven miles of London
without licence; the case upon a special verdict was,
that the Defendant being an Apothecary by trade was
sent to by <i>John Seale</i><a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c011'><sup>[96]</sup></a>, then sick of a certain distemper,
and he having seen him, and being informed
of the said distemper, did without prescription or advice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>of a Doctor and without any fee for advice, compound
and send the said <i>John Seale</i> several parcels of
physic as proper for his said distemper, only taking
the price of his drugs; and if this were a practising
of physic, such as is prohibited by the Statute was the
question: and after several arguments the Court at
last unanimously agreed, That practising of Physic
within this statute consists, 1st, In judging of the disease
and its nature, constitution of the patient, and
many other circumstances. 2ndly, In judging of the
fittest and properest remedy for the disease. And
3dly, In directing and ordering the application of
the remedy to the diseased. And that the proper
business of an Apothecary is to make and compound,
or prepare the prescriptions of the doctor pursuant to
his directions. It was also agreed, That the Defendant’s
taking upon himself to send physic to a patient
as proper for his distemper without taking ought for
his pains, is plainly a taking upon himself to judge of
the disease and fitness of the remedy, as also the executive
or directing part. <i>Et per tot. Cur.</i> The Plaintiff
had judgment. 6 <i>Mod.</i> 44. 16 <i>Vin. Abr.</i> 341. Against
this judgment the Defendant <i>Rose</i> brought a Writ of
Error to the House of Lords, “That judgment having
been given in the Queen’s Bench against the
now Plaintiff on a special verdict, he humbly hopes
the same shall be reversed for these reasons:</p>

<p class='c000'>“That the consequence of this judgment will entirely
ruin the Plaintiff in his trade, and indeed all
other Apothecaries, since they can’t (if this judgment
be affirmed) use their professions without the
prescript or license of a Physician.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That the constant use and practice<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c011'><sup>[97]</sup></a> which has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>always been with the Apothecary, shall as we humbly
hope be judged the best expounder of this
Charter: and that selling a few lozenges, or a
small electuary, to any asking a remedy for a cold,
or in other ordinary or common cases, or where the
medicine has known and certain effects, may not
be deemed unlawful, or practising as a Physician,
when no fee is taken or demanded for the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That the Physicians by straining an Act made so
long ago, may not be able to monopolize all manner
of Physic solely to themselves; and the rather,
for that such a construction will not only be the
undoing of the Apothecaries, but also,</p>

<p class='c000'>“1. A tax on the Nobility and Gentry, who in the
slightest cases, even for their servants, can’t then
have any kind of medicines, without consulting and
giving a fee to one of the College.</p>

<p class='c000'>“2. An oppression to the poorer families not able
to go to the charge of a fee; the suppressing of the
Apothecaries being to deprive such poor people and
families of all manner of assistance in their necessities.</p>

<p class='c000'>“3. A certain prejudice to all sick persons on sudden
accidents, and new symptoms arising, especially
in acute diseases, and in the night, wherein if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Apothecary is called, and shall dare to apply the
least remedy, he runs the hazard of being ruined,
or the Patient the danger of being lost.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For all which, and several other errors in the
Record, it is humbly prayed,” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must be observed that these reasons turn on the
policy and not on the law of the question, and would
have been better addressed to the House of Peers in
their legislative, than in their judicial capacity; the
hardship of depriving the Apothecaries of all practice,
and the inexpediency of too strictly enforcing the
statute of <i>Henry</i> 8th, might have justified an application
to the Legislature for an alteration of the law,
but they could not warrant even the highest tribunal
in the land in departing from the law established by
Act of Parliament, and gravely decided by the judges;
we must therefore conclude that some better arguments
were adduced on the hearing than have been
handed down to us by the reporters; for if seeing the
patient, judging of the complaint, and administering
the proper remedies for it, be not a practising of Physic
within the meaning of the statute, we must confess
ourselves utterly at a loss to define the practice which
is. It is a futile and unworthy subterfuge to allege
that no fee is taken for advice, and that the sum
charged is only the price of the drugs, for the contrary
is evident; the poacher might as well pretend
(as has been done) that he sells the basket at his own
price, and throws the hare into the bargain, as a compliment
to the purchaser,—or the vender of nostrums
might attempt to avoid the stamp duty by selling the
bottles and giving the physic. We are very far indeed
from wishing to put unfair restraints on trade,
or to deprive any class of men of the free exercise of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>their professional abilities, but as the Legislature has
deemed it necessary to guard the corporeal health of
the people, by enacting that only persons who on examination
by a competent authority have been found
of sufficient ability shall practise, we have thought it
our duty to point out the law as it stands, and if in
doing so we are occasionally obliged to hint at defects,
we do it in the hope that by drawing abler attention
to a neglected subject, we may incidentally give rise
to some improvements, beneficial not only to the public
at large, but ultimately profitable to those who, at
the first glance might think themselves injuriously
affected by them.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have noticed that the reasons alleged by Writ
of Error against the judgment of the Court of King’s
Bench in the case of <i>The College of Physicians against
Rose</i>, do not appear to us to have been legally satisfactory,
the judgment of the King’s Bench<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c011'><sup>[98]</sup></a> however
was reversed, (<i>see</i> 1 <i>Brown’s Parl. Ca.</i> 78. <i>and
Appendix</i>, 126), and consequently the greater portion
of the practice of Physic has been transferred to
the Apothecaries. This was for some time a very
serious evil; they who had been educated as mere
compounders, suddenly became prescribers of medicine;
it is easy to conceive how large a portion of
ignorance and empiricism was thus let loose upon
the public: the mischief has indeed gradually decreased,
as many men of liberal education have entered
the field thus enlarged for them, and the natural
effect of competition has induced improvement; still
something is wanting. In large towns and among the
higher and middle classes of society, talent and mediocrity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>soon find their proper levels; but at a distance
in the country, ignorance and imposture may
erect their stages at least with impunity, and more
than probably with success; we have ourselves heard
most lamentable accounts of the mal-practice to which
the poor and ignorant have been subjected by low
country practitioners and their assistants; for the interpretation
of the law which let in the Apothecary
to unrestrained practice, could not exclude the apprentice,
and we therefore find the shop-boy in cases
of emergency visiting and prescribing for his master’s
poorer patients.</p>

<p class='c000'>For these, among other reasons, the Apothecaries’
Company have obtained an Act of Parliament to alter
and enlarge the powers of their Charter. “And
whereas much mischief and inconvenience has
arisen from great numbers of persons in many parts
of England and Wales exercising the functions of
an Apothecary who are wholly ignorant, and utterly
incompetent to the exercise of such functions,
whereby the health and lives of the community are
greatly endangered; and it is become necessary
that provision should be made for remedying such
evils; Be it therefore, &amp;c.” This passage, from a
Statute solicited by the Apothecaries themselves, will
exonerate us from any imputation of illiberal remark;
we sincerely hope that the Act will produce the intended
benefit, though when we have occasion to
treat of it more at large under the head of the <i>Apothecaries
Company</i>, we may have occasion to point
out some particulars in which we think it might be
amended.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have thus cited the leading cases on unlicensed
practice, and the authorities which we have quoted
will enable the medical reader desirous of better information,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to pursue the enquiry to the fountain head.
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melius est petere fontes quam sectare rivulos.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c000'>The next branch of the jurisdiction of the College
is yet more important, as it extends to the control
and punishment of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mala Praxis</span></i><a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c011'><sup>[99]</sup></a>, whether by persons
licensed or unlicensed. On this head the leading
case is that of <i>Groenvelt and Burwell</i><a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c011'><sup>[100]</sup></a>, (1 <i>Comyns</i>
76: 1 <i>Salk</i> 396; <i>see Appendix</i>). A complaint having
been made to the College of Physicians, informing
them that Dr. <i>Groenvelt</i> had administered Cantharides
in powder, he was summoned before the Censors and
by them committed for <i>mala Praxis</i>; for this imprisonment
he brought his action in the King’s Bench,
<i>Trin.</i> 12 <i>Will.</i> 3. from which it appears that “The
Censors of the College of Physicians in London are
impowered to inspect, govern, and censure all
Practisers of Physic in <i>Civitate</i> London and seven
miles round, so as to punish by fine, amerciament,
and imprisonment. Per <i>Holt</i> Ch. J. the Censors
<em>have a judicial Power</em>; for a power to examine,
convict, and punish, is judicial, and they are judges
of record because they can fine and imprison, and
being judges of the matter, what they have adjudged
is not traversable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mala Praxis</span></i> it matters not whether the party
offending be a member of the College, a Licenciate,
or an unlicensed Practitioner, for the Statute gives
jurisdiction over all Physicians whatsoever, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeant
supervisum et scrutinium, correctionem et gubernationem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>omnium et singulorum dictæ civitatis medicorum
utentium facultate Medicinæ in eadem civitate
ac aliorum medicorum forensicorum quorumcunque
facultatem illam medicinæ aliquo modo frequentantium
et utentium infra eandem civitatem et suburbia
ejusdem sive infra septem miliaria in circuitu ejusdem
civitatis</span></i>,” and Ch. J. <i>Holt</i> says, “Though a person
be not one of the College, yet if he practise
Physic within their jurisdiction, he ought to subject
himself to the law as well as any other.” 12 <i>Mod</i>
393. And for those who are not Physicians but have
assumed the character, they must take it <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cum onere</span></i>,
and will be estopped from pleading the illegality of
their practice when punished for the irregularity of
their prescriptions: it is to be wished however that
the words of the Charter were more explicit in this
particular.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor are the Censors liable to any action for error
in judgment, for “though the Pills and Medicines
were really <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salubres Pilulæ et bona Medicamenta</span></i>,
yet no action lies against the Censors; because it
is a wrong judgment in a matter within the limits
of their jurisdiction, and a judge is not answerable,
either to the king or the party, for the mistakes or
errors of his judgment, in a matter of which he has
jurisdiction: it would expose the justice of the nation,
and no man would execute the office upon
peril of being arraigned by action or indictment
for every judgment he pronounces.” (1 <i>Salk</i>, 397).</p>

<p class='c000'>“<i>Holt</i> Ch. J. said, it seemed to him that the
Censors may tender an oath as a necessary consequence
of their judicial power; but said he would
give no positive opinion.” <i>Dr. Grenville</i> v <i>Coll.
of Phys.</i> 12 <i>Mod.</i> 392. 16 <i>Vin. Ab.</i> 345. the general
rule is, that where a statute confers a power, the law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>supplies all necessary incidents required for its execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the 10th <i>Geo.</i> 1. <i>cap.</i> 20. <i>s.</i> 7. Where any person
is condemned by the Censors for not well executing,
practising, or using the faculty of Physic, he
may within fourteen days after notice appeal to the
College, and the judgment given on such appeal shall
be final. Sect. 3. of the same act gives a similar right
of appeal to Apothecaries. But this Act, as we have
before observed, has expired; should its enactments
ever be revived, this right of appeal should not be
omitted, for it is expedient that some control should
be exercised over all summary jurisdictions. To the
policy of the 3d and 6th sections we cannot so readily
give our assent; the one exempts drugs in merchants
warehouses from search, and the other enacts that
Patentees for the sole making any medicine shall not
be prejudiced thereby. By the first of these the
Censors are excluded from some known manufactories
of factitious drugs, and an important security
is taken away from our export trade, for it is evident
that foreigners would more readily buy the drugs
which have passed through our hands, if they were
assured that their quality had been subjected to strict
and competent scrutiny. To Patent Medicines we may
be allowed to avow our most decided hostility, and
as it is notorious that the greater part of them are
not made up according to their specifications, we
may without charge of illiberal prejudice claim for
the public some security that the preparations which
they buy as “<em>mild vegetable extracts</em>,” may not be
clandestinely poisoned with Antimony, Mercury, and
Arsenic. It may be said that the public have a
remedy by the forfeiture of the Patent consequent on
the falsehood of the specification, but this can only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>be effected by an expensive process to which the
mere purchaser of a phial of trash may not choose to
subject himself, even if he have skill enough to
detect the fraud practised upon him.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c011'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>We have thus shown by repeated precedents that
none can legally practise Physic in London, or within
seven miles circuit of the city, who are not either
Fellows or Licenciates of the College, nor can any,
except Graduates in Physic of Oxford and Cambridge,
lawfully practise in the country, without a
similar license; yet, as the Act of Parliament has
annexed no specific penalty to the transgression, the
only remedy in such case is by indictment for a misdemeanor:
for where there is no punishment attached
by statute to the violation of a prohibitory
clause in an Act of Parliament, this indictment lies.
(See 4 <i>Term Rep.</i> 202.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Unfortunately the history of the College litigations
does not cease with their proceedings against unlicensed
practitioners; they have also had to contend,
on the defensive, with their own Licenciates,
who have claimed a full participation in the rights
and privileges of the Fellows:<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c011'><sup>[102]</sup></a> we hope most earnestly
that the question is now at rest, and that the
cases we are about to cite may serve as beacons to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>avoid <a id='pas'></a>past errors, not as precedents for future proceedings.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It would require a volume,” says Sir <i>James
Burrows</i>, vol. 4. p. 2186, “to give a full and particular
detail of this long contest between the Fellows
and the Licenciates; which was litigated with
great spirit and eagerness between several very
learned and respectable gentlemen of the faculty
on both sides. It must not therefore be attempted
within the compass of a collection, already perhaps
too faulty in this respect<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c011'><sup>[103]</sup></a>, as being in many instances
more minute and circumstantial than may
appear absolutely necessary, or at all agreeable to
some readers.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The substance of it ought not however to be
omitted, which was as follows.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A rule had been obtained upon the application
of Doctor <i>Letch</i> for the College of Physicians to
shew cause why a mandamus should not issue,
directed to them, commanding them to admit <i>John
Letch</i>, Doctor of Physic, to be a member of the
College.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“This Rule was made upon the whole body of the
College or Community of the Faculty of Physic of
the city of London; and also on the President and
Censors of the said College.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“Mr. <i>Yorke</i> against the Rule, Sir <i>Fletcher Norton</i>
for it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The short state of the material facts, with respect
to this mandamus, was, that Doctor <i>Letch</i>, who
practised as a Man-Midwife,<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c011'><sup>[104]</sup></a> was summoned by
the College to be examined. He thereupon came
in, and was examined thrice at the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia minora</span></i>:
And after the third of these examinations, he
was there balloted for ‘Whether he should be
<em>approved of by them</em> or not.’ A dispute arose
upon this ballot. The majority of the number of
balls <em>appeared</em> to be for approving him: but one
of the Censors declared ‘that he had by mistake
put in his ball for approbation; which he meant
and intended to be against approving him.’ It was
proposed to ballot over again, but the President
declared this to be an approbation by a majority of
votes on the ballot. On Doctor <i>Letch</i> being proposed
to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia majora</span></i>, nineteen to three of
the members present were against putting the College
Seal to his letters testimonial. And he was
informed that he was not elected.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“His Counsel insisted that having been returned
sufficient by the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia minora</span></i>, he had already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>acquired an inchoate right to admission, which the
Court would enforce the completion of, by mandamus.”<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c011'><sup>[105]</sup></a>
For the argument and authorities vide
<i>Rex</i> v. <i>Askew</i> <i>ubi supra</i> and <i>Appendix</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lord <i>Mansfield</i> in his judgment laid down the
following among other rules.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Court (i. e. of King’s Bench) has jurisdiction
over Corporate Bodies to see that they act
agreeably to the end of their institution.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where a party who has a right has no other specific
legal remedy, the Court will assist him by
issuing this prerogative writ (i. e. <i>mandamus</i>) in
order to his obtaining such right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But it is not a writ that is to issue of course, or
to be granted merely for asking.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The College are obliged in conformity to the
trust and confidence placed in them by the Crown
and the public, to admit all that are fit; and to
reject all that are unfit.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The judgment and discretion in determining on
skill, learning, and sufficiency to practise physic, is
trusted to the College, and the Court will not interrupt
them in the due and proper exercise of it.
But their conduct in the exercise of this trust thus
committed to them ought to be fair, candid and
unprejudiced; not arbitrary, capricious or biassed;
much less warped by resentment or personal dislike.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is possible that other causes of rejection than
insufficiency of skill may occur, as <em>badness of morals</em>,
for instance; of these the Court will judge.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If they should refuse to examine the candidate at
all, the Court will oblige them to do it.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“The power (of admission) remains with the body;
and the examination by the President and four Censors
is only preparatory, and for the ease of the
body at large.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Every Fellow may examine and argue with the
candidate in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia minora</span></i> though he has no
vote <em>there</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The delegation to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia minora</span></i> to examine
is good.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Justice <i>Aston</i> followed Mr. Justice <i>Yates</i> in
saying that Doctor <i>Letch</i> should rather have applied
for a mandamus requiring the College to
grant him a license to practise within London and
seven miles of it, than for a mandamus to admit
him as a member.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">comitia majora</span></i> acted with great moderation
in admitting him to another examination.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Justice <i>Hewit</i> declined giving any opinion
(on a point started in argument) whether London
Licenciates are <em>members</em> of the College or not;
though he hinted, that the more he thought of it,
the more he doubted it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We should go a great way if we should say ‘that
a Licenciate to practise within <i>London</i> and seven
miles round is a <em>member</em> of the College’.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The Rule was accordingly discharged by the
unanimous opinion of the Court.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the matter did not rest here; the notion that
the Licenciates were entitled to be considered as
Members of the College, under the term Commonalty
or otherwise, gained ground; and accordingly two
terms after the original argument and judgment, Sir
<i>Fletcher Norton</i> (afterwards Lord <i>Eardly</i>) moved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>for a Rule upon Dr. <i>Askew</i> and others (the four then
Censors), for them to shew cause why an information
in nature of a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quo warranto</span></i> should not be granted
against them, to shew by what authority they acted
as Censors of the College of Physicians.</p>

<p class='c000'>The objection was, that whereas the election ought
to be by the <em>whole</em> body, these gentlemen had been
elected only by a <em>select</em> body; namely by the Fellows,
<em>exclusive</em> of the Licenciates, who <em>demanded admittance</em>;
which was refused them by the Fellows, on pretence
of their having no business there, upon that occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>After an argument on three several days, during
which Sir <i>Fletcher Norton</i>, Mr. <i>Morton</i>, Mr. <i>Wedderburn</i>
(afterwards Lord <i>Roslyn</i>,)<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c011'><sup>[106]</sup></a> Serjeant <i>Glynn</i>,
Mr. <i>Walker</i>, and Mr. <i>Mansfield</i> (afterwards Chief
Justice of the Common Pleas), were heard for the
Licenciates, and Mr. <i>Yorke</i> (afterwards Lord <i>Chancellor</i>),
Mr. <i>Dunning</i> (afterwards Lord <i>Ashburnham</i>),
Serjeant <i>Davy</i>, Mr. <i>Ashurst</i> (afterwards a Judge),
and Mr. <i>Wallace</i> for the College, Lord <i>Mansfield</i>
delivered his opinion.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c011'><sup>[107]</sup></a> “The question now before
us is singly this, Whether the persons applying for
the information <em>are Fellows</em> and <em>entitled to vote</em> in
the election of Censors. If they are, the election of
these Censors, being made in <em>exclusion</em> of their
votes, is <em>not good</em>. If they are not Fellows, and
have no right to vote in the election of Censors,
then this election stands unimpeached.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The question is, “Whether these <i>Licenciates</i> are
Socii, or Collegæ, or Fellows,” which are synonimous
terms.</p>

<p class='c000'>The facts are not disputed: and there is no doubt
about the law. It has been admitted on both sides
that there has been a great number of <em>by-laws</em> and
<em>long-usages</em>; and the permission of these Licenciates
<em>to practise</em> is not disputed. But I doubt whether this
<em>permission to practise</em>, and these <em>letters testimonial</em>,
can amount to an admission into the Fellowship of
the Corporation or College. Nothing can make
a man a Fellow of the College without the <i>Act of the
College</i>. The power of examining, and admitting
after examination, was not an arbitrary power, <em>but a
power coupled with a trust</em>. They are bound to admit
every person whom upon examination they think to
be fit to be admitted, within the description of the
Charter and the Act of Parliament which confirms it.
The person who comes within that description has a
<em>right</em> to be admitted into the <em>Fellowship</em>; he has a
claim to several exemptions, privileges, and advantages,
attendant upon admission into the <em>Fellowship</em>;
and not only the candidate himself, if found fit, has a
personal right, but the <em>public</em> has also a right to his
service; and that not only as a physician, but as a
censor, as an elect, as an <em>officer</em> in the offices to which he
will upon admission become eligible.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c011'><sup>[108]</sup></a> They have
power not only by their charter, but by the law of
the land, to make fit and reasonable by-laws, subject
to certain qualifications. It appears from the Charter
and the Act of Parliament, that the Charter had an
idea of persons who might practise physic in <i>London</i>
and yet not be Fellows of the College. The President
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>was to overlook <em>not only</em> the College, but also
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnes homines ejusdem facultatis</span></i>.” So when the
College or Corporation were to make by-laws, these
by-laws were to relate <em>not only</em> to the Fellows, but
to <em>all others</em> practising physic within <i>London</i> or seven
miles of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then let us see how the usage was.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1555 they must have had a probationary license
before admission into the College. Afterwards it was
to be a probation for four years before admission.
The College might grant such probationary licenses,
with some reason, and agreeably to their Institution.
This shews that some licenses were granted to persons
not Fellows of the College. The 3 H. 8 takes
away all former privileges.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c011'><sup>[109]</sup></a> In 1561, a <em>partial</em>
license was granted to an occulist. A person may be
fit to practise in <em>one</em> branch who is <em>not</em> fit to <a id='prac'></a>practise in
<em>another</em>. Licenses have also been granted to <em>women</em>.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c011'><sup>[110]</sup></a>
<em>Partial</em> licenses have been given for above 200 years.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c011'><sup>[111]</sup></a>
In 1581 notice is taken of <em>three classes</em>: Fellows,
Candidates, and Licenciates. The licenses probably
took their rise from that illegal by-law (now at an
end) which restrained the number of Fellows to
twenty.</p>

<p class='c000'>This being premised, let us inquire “Who these
gentlemen are that are now applying to the Court.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They are persons who set up a title directly contrary
to the <em>sense</em> in which their license is given <em>to</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>them and received by them. They cannot avail themselves
of their instruments in this way: it would be
a <em>cheat</em> upon the College. And they have acquiesced
many years under this license given them by the College,
as merely a license to practise.</p>

<p class='c000'>But even supposing them to have a right to be
Fellows, yet, as it is clear that the license does not
make them <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</span></i> Fellows, they could not vote <em>in
the election</em> of Censors <em>before their</em> admission to the
Fellowship; and therefore the exclusion of their
votes cannot impeach this election.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am of opinion “that this rule ought to be discharged.”</p>

<p class='c000'>His Lordship (but this was <i>obiter</i>) then made some
comment on the statutes and by-laws of the College;
and recommended their revisal under the best advice,
saying, “I see a source of great dispute and litigation
in them as they now stand.”<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c011'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Justice <i>Yates</i> concurred with the Chief, as did
Mr. Justice <i>Aston</i> on some points; but upon the construction
of the Charter and Act of Parliament, he
thought that in grants of this kind, the construction
ought to be made in a <em>liberal</em> manner; and this grant
includes “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnes homines ejusdem facultatis de et in
civitate prædictâ</span></i>,” and the application to Parliament
for the Act of 14 and 15 H. 8. to confirm the Charter
is made by the six persons particularly named in it,
“<em>and all other men of the same faculty</em> within the City
of London and seven miles about.” It seemed to him
that the idea was “that all persons duly qualified,
who took testimonials under the College seal, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>to be of the community.” He should, however, give
no opinion, he said, how it might turn out upon a
<i>mandamus</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Justice <i>Willes</i>, confining himself to the subject
in question, concluded, “they cannot before their admission
maintain this rule.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord <i>Mansfield</i> and Mr. Justice <i>Yates</i> said they
gave no opinion how it might be upon a <i>mandamus</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court were unanimous in discharging the
rule.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hint thrown out by three of the Judges was
followed up by the Licenciates. On Thursday, 17th
Nov. 1768, Sir <i>F. Norton</i> and Mr. <i>Norton</i> moved the
Court on behalf of Doctor <i>Edward Archer</i>, and Mr.
<i>Walker</i> on behalf of Dr. <i>Fothergill</i>, for writs of <i>mandamus</i>,
to oblige the College to admit these two Licenciates,
with an intention to try the question
“whether the Licenciates had a right to be admitted
Fellows;” and that litigation lasted till June 1771.
But they only came round to the same point which
had been already determined, as above; for these
two gentlemen had accepted licenses <em>under the by-law</em>
of 1737, and the Court were of opinion “that
they ought not afterwards to desert it, and treat it
as null and void; and set up a right of admission
under the Charter, upon the foundation of this very
license which they had accepted <em>under the by-law</em>,
upon the supposition that the by-law was a bad one.”
So that the return was allowed, upon that objection
to their claim. And the intended question remained
unsettled. See 5 Burr. 2740, where also will be
found the form of the mandamus and the return.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c011'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>The last case on this subject is that of Doctor
<i>Stanger</i>. (7 Term Rep. 282, which as the most recent
decision, and for the luminous judgment of Lord
<i>Kenyon</i>, we have inserted in the appendix.) This,
like the cases in <i>Burrows</i>, was argued by the most
celebrated lawyers of the day, Mr. Serjeant <i>Adair</i>,
Mr. <i>Law</i>, (afterward Lord <i>Ellenborough</i>) Mr.
<i>Chambre</i>, (afterward a Judge) Mr. <i>Christian</i>, (now
Chief Justice of <i>Ely</i>) having argued in support of
the rule; and Mr. <i>Erskine</i>, (afterward Chancellor)
Mr. <i>Gibbs</i>, (Chief Justice C. P.) Mr. <i>Dampier</i>, (a
Judge) and Mr. <i>Warren</i>, (now Chief Justice of <i>Chester</i>)
against it. The rule for a <i>mandamus</i> was discharged;<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c011'><sup>[114]</sup></a>
it may therefore now be considered as a
resolved point of law, that a Doctor of Physic, who
has been licensed by the College of Physicians to practise
physic in <i>London</i> and within seven miles, cannot
claim as a matter of right to be examined in order to
his being admitted a Fellow of the College. The
College, who have power by their Charter (confirmed
by Act of Parliament) to make by-laws, have made
by-laws respecting the qualifications of persons to be
admitted; by them it is ordained that no person shall
be admitted into the class of candidates before admission
into the College, unless he has taken a degree of
M. D. at Oxford, Cambridge, or Dublin, except in
two cases: in one of those cases the President may
propose in every other year a Doctor of Physic of a
certain standing, and if he be approved by the College,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>he may be admitted a Fellow; in the other,
any Fellow may propose a Doctor of Physic of a certain
age and standing, and if approved at certain
meetings he may be admitted a Fellow. And it was
ruled that these were reasonable by-laws.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following may now be considered as the legal
classes of Physicians. 1st. The actual members of
the College of Physicians, divided into their several
denominations of President, Elects, and Fellows.</p>

<p class='c000'>2d. Those who, being graduates of the universities
of Oxford and Cambridge, are licensed to practise
by the College in London and within seven miles
during their respective periods of probation, previous
to becoming Fellows; these are Candidates who,
being Doctors of Physic, have undergone their examination
for the Fellowship, and at the end of one
year are capable of becoming members or Fellows of
the College; and inceptor Candidates,<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c011'><sup>[115]</sup></a> who being
Bachelors of Physic aspire to the Fellowship.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>3d. The medical graduates of our two Universities.</p>

<p class='c000'>4th. The Licenciates who are admitted by the College
to practise in London and within seven miles, and
the extra Licenciates who are admitted to practise
in the country but not within the privileged district
of the College.</p>

<p class='c000'>These are the laws respecting Physicians as a body
Corporate; we have not added their Statutes as they
are separately printed, although they have never
been published by the authority of the College. It
now remains for us to notice their rights as individuals,
the exemptions to which they are entitled,
and the actions to which they are liable.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c011'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c008'>2. OF THE COLLEGE OF SURGEONS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>The</span> present College of Surgeons owes its existence
to the Act of the 18th <i>Geo.</i> 2. <i>c.</i> 15. (<i>see Appendix</i>,
p. 30), by which the Surgeons of London are separated
from the Barbers, with whom they had been
made one Company and Body Corporate, by the 32nd
<i>Hen.</i> 8. <i>c.</i> 40. (<i>see Appendix</i>, p. 14),<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c011'><sup>[117]</sup></a> previous
to which period (A. D. 1540) the Surgeons had no incorporation;
they had indeed petitioned for and obtained
an Act of Parliament under the name of the
Wardens and Fellowship of the craft and mystery of
Surgeons enfranchised in London, stating their number
not to exceed twelve persons, to which number
the relief from “quests and other things” granted by
the Act (5th <i>Hen.</i> 8. <i>c.</i> 6. <i>see Appendix</i>, p. 5), is
limited; but it is evident by the preamble to the
32nd <i>Hen.</i> 8. that they, though called a Company,
“be not incorporate nor have any manner of corporation”
previous to that period. The examination
of Surgeons, as that of Physicians also, had been confided
to the bishops (3 <i>Hen.</i> 8. <i>c.</i> 11.), nor does it
appear that the subsequent Act of <i>Henry</i> remedied
this defect. By the 18th <i>Geo.</i> 2. however they have
been made a separate and distinct Body Corporate and
Commonalty, under the name of <i>Masters, Governors,
and Commonalty of the art and science of Surgeons of
<span class='sc'>London</span></i>, by which name they may sue and be sued;
(<i>Appendix</i>, p. 39). All liberties, privileges, franchises,
powers, and authorities, which they might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>have enjoyed under the united Company and their
Act of Parliament, or under the Letters Patent of
<i>Charles</i> the 1st, or the other Royal Grants, Charters,
and Patents, therein mentioned and referred to, so far
as they relate to the science of Surgery, are confirmed
to them (§ 8. <i>Appendix</i>, p. 43). Now the Charter of
<i>Charles</i> the 1st, as recited in the preamble of this
Act, grants that “no person or persons whatsoever,
whether a freeman of the said society or a foreigner,
or a native of England, or an alien, should use or
exercise the said art or science of Surgery within
the said cities of <i>London</i> and <i>Westminster</i> or either
of them, or within the distance of seven miles of the
said city of London, for his or their private lucre
or profit, (except such Physicians as are therein
mentioned) unless the said person or persons were
first tried and examined in the presence of two or
more of the Masters or Governors of the mystery
and commonalty aforesaid for the time being, by
four or more of the said examiners so to be elected
and constituted as aforesaid and by the publick
Letters Testimonial of the same Masters or Governors
under their common seal approved of and admitted
to exercise the said art or science of Surgery,
according to the laws and statutes of the kingdom
of <i>England</i>, under the penalty in the said Letters
Patent mentioned.”<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c011'><sup>[118]</sup></a>. (<i>see Appendix</i>, p. 36).
The same Charter provides “That no one, whether
a freeman of the mystery or commonalty aforesaid,
or a foreigner, whether a native of England, or an
alien, exercising the art of Surgery within the cities
of <i>London</i> and <i>Westminster</i> or the suburbs or liberties
thereof, or within seven miles of the said city
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>of <i>London</i>, should go out from the port of <i>London</i>,
or send out any apprentice, servant, or other person
whomsoever, from the said port, to execute or
undertake the place or office of a Surgeon for any
ship, whether in the service of the Crown, or of any
merchant or others, unless they and their medicines,
instruments and chests respectively, were
first examined, inspected, and allowed by two such
Masters or Governors of the mystery and commonalty
aforesaid for the time being, as were
skilled, knowing and professors in the same art of
Surgery, under the penalty therein mentioned;”
(<i>see Appendix</i>, p. 37). And the Act (§ 9. <i>Appendix</i>,
p. 44,) following the same principle, enacts “That
from and after the said first day of July, One
thousand seven hundred and forty-five, the Examiners
of the Company of Surgeons established by
this Act shall, and they are hereby required, from
time to time upon request to them made, to examine
every person who shall be a candidate to be
appointed to serve as a Surgeon or a Surgeon’s
mate, of any regiment, troop, company, hospital or
garrison of soldiers in the service of his Majesty,
his heirs or successors, in like manner as they do
or shall examine any Surgeon or Surgeons to be
appointed to serve on board any ship or vessel in
the service of his Majesty, his heirs or successors.”</p>

<p class='c000'>By section 3, (<i>see Appendix</i>, p. 39,) the College is
empowered to hold Courts and Assemblies and to
make By-laws, Ordinances, Rules, and Constitutions
for the government of the Corporation, and those of
the united Company concerning Surgery are declared
to be in force till repealed. (§ 4. p. 40). By section
11 (<i>see Appendix</i>, p. 45,) it is provided that nothing
contained in the Act shall abridge or infringe any of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>the privileges, authorities, &amp;c. of the College of Physicians.</p>

<p class='c000'>These are the Acts of Parliament which at present
regulate the profession of a Surgeon; it is evident
that they are imperfect, as they do not give any
power to restrain and punish ignorant pretenders,
who without the slightest qualification assume this
dangerous and difficult branch of practice, and most
especially in the country. We are aware that any
attempt of the medical Corporations to obtain an increase
of their power, would create much outcry among
those who are interested in the perpetuation of existing
abuses; but we will hope that the public safety
will be preferred to the private views of empirics;
and that a due system of examination, license, and
restriction of surgical practice throughout England,
will shortly receive the sanction of the legislature.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have only found one reported case of any consequence
in which the College of Surgeons have been
parties. In <i>Rex v. the Master and Wardens of the
Company of Surgeons in London</i>, it was determined
that a By-law requiring apprentices to have a competent
knowledge of the Latin language, is good and
reasonable; (<i>see</i> 2 <i>Bur.</i> 892. <i>and Appendix</i>). Continual
attempts have been made to decry the value of
classical attainment in the medical professor; the legal
authorities however agree that the Corporations
have the right of prescribing a due course of education
as a necessary preliminary to admission; and we
sincerely hope that these learned bodies will never
abandon this principle, that none shall be admitted to
the higher honors of their profession, who are not
possessed of the ordinary acquirements of gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1800 the Surgeons of London obtained
a new Charter from his late Majesty, which after reciting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the previous Charters and Acts of Parliament
which we have noticed, proceeds thus: “And whereas
we are informed that the said Corporation of Master
Governors and Commonalty of the art and science
of Surgeons of London, hath become and now is
dissolved,” &amp;c. therefore His Majesty was pleased
to incorporate the members of the late Company, and
all such persons who, since the dissolution thereof,
have obtained Letters Testimonial, &amp;c. and confirmed
to such new Corporation all gifts, grants, liberties,
privileges, and immunities, possessions real and personal,
&amp;c. granted or confirmed by any previous Charter
or Act of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c000'>We confess ourselves at a loss to trace either the
mode or date of the alleged dissolution; the Act of
the 18th <i>Geo.</i> 2. is explicit as to the creation of a College
of Surgeons, and we consequently find them recognised
in the character of a Corporation in the cited
case <i>Rex v. the Master and Wardens</i> (<i>Appendix</i> p. 153),
which was tried in the 33d of <i>Geo.</i> 2.; but as the
College have themselves admitted the fact, we must
take it for granted that the recital is correct; how far
the Charter of <i>Geo.</i> 3. unconfirmed by an Act of Parliament
can revive their ancient rights may be a most
material question; but as we are of opinion that the
rights of this body should rather be increased than
diminished we do not at present enter into it, in the
hope that the defect, if it exist, will be shortly remedied
by the Legislature.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c011'><sup>[119]</sup></a>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>3. OF THE SOCIETY OF APOTHECARIES.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c011'><sup>[120]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>In 1666 the Apothecaries and Grocers were united
in one Company by Charter of the 4th of <i>James</i> the
First, but this union did not long continue, for in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>1615, by Charter of the 13th of the same king,<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c011'><sup>[121]</sup></a> the
Companies were again separated (see <i>Goodall</i>’s collect.
p. 119. <i>Appendix</i> 71.) This was done upon the
representation of some of the Apothecaries, backed
by the approval of Doctors <i>Mayerne</i> and <i>Atkins</i>, then
the King’s physicians, by whose interest and solicitation
this new Charter appears to have been obtained.
The Letters Patent, after reciting the Charter
of the 4th of the King, and that many empirics
and ignorant persons had taken upon themselves the
art and mystery of Pharmacoplists, compounding
hurtful, corrupt and pernicious drugs, declared that
the Apothecaries of and within seven miles compass of
the City of London should thenceforth be separated
from the Grocers, and be made a Corporation, under
the names of the Master, Wardens and Society of the
art and mystery of Pharmacopolists in London, to
sue and be sued as other Corporations; to have a common
seal, and power to purchase and hold lands in
fee simple or for years. To be subject however to
the magistracy of the City of London, as other City
companies. None but natural born subjects to be
members. The Company or Society is enabled to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>elect a Master, two Wardens, and twenty-one Assistants,
in the manner prescribed, to have a hall or
council house, to keep a court or convocation to
consult on statutes, laws, articles, &amp;c. The power
of making By-Laws for the government of the society
is vested in the Master, Wardens and Assistants, or
thirteen of them (of whom the Master must be one),
on public summons; provided however that in all
orders concerning medicines and their composition
they should consult with the President and Censors
of the College of Physicians, or with some other physicians
named for that purpose by the President.
They have power to punish by fines and amercements
to the use of the Company, without giving account,
but such fines must be moderate and not contrary to
law. The first Master (<i>Edm. Phillips</i>), Wardens
and Assistants<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c011'><sup>[122]</sup></a> are named in the Letters Patents,
with special direction as to the manner in which they
are to take their respective oaths of office, and the
future election of Master and Wardens is vested in
the Assistants, who have also the sole power of filling
up vacancies in their own number, whether caused by
death, removal or otherwise; with power to administer
the oath of office, as well to every Master and
Warden as to every newly elected Assistant. No
Grocer or other person whatsoever may keep an
Apothecaries shop for the compounding medicines,
&amp;c. till he have served seven years apprenticeship to
some Apothecary, nor can such Apprentice be made
free unless allowed by the President of the College
of Physicians,<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c011'><sup>[123]</sup></a> or some Physician or Physicians deputed
by him, who is or are to be present at the
examination by the Master and Wardens (if upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>notice such Physician or Physicians shall be unwilling
to attend.) The Company have power to enter the
shops and houses of all persons following the mystery
of Apothecaries, both in the City and suburbs, to
search and try medicines, and to burn all unwholesome
and hurtful medicines before the doors of the
delinquents, in which all civil officers are to give them
all necessary assistance; this power is however to be
without prejudice to the rights and privileges of the
President of the College of Physicians, who are to
enjoy all powers and authorities as before<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c011'><sup>[124]</sup></a>, and
especially to have the same power in their searches
to call the Master and Wardens of the Apothecaries
Company as of the Grocers. Lastly, the practice of
Surgeons is confirmed, so that they do not vend
medicines after the manner of Apothecaries.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Charter was lately confirmed (except as therein
altered) by Act of Parliament, 55 <i>Geo.</i> 3. <i>c.</i> 194. By
this Statute the Company’s former power of search for
unwholesome medicines is repealed, and in lieu
thereof the Master, Wardens and Society of Apothecaries,
or any of the Assistants, or any other person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>or persons properly qualified to be by the Master and
Wardens assigned, not being fewer in number than
two, shall, as often as to the said Master and Wardens
may seem expedient, enter in the day time, any shop
of any person using the art and mystery of an Apothecary
in any part of <i>England</i> or <i>Wales</i>, and search
if the medicines, simple or compound, Wares, Drugs,
or any thing whatsoever therein contained and
belonging to the art or mystery of Apothecaries, be
wholsome, meet and fit for the cure, health, and ease
of his Majesty’s subjects; and all and every such
medicines, wares, drugs, and all other things belonging
to the aforesaid art, which they shall find false,
unlawful, deceitful, stale, unwholsome, corrupt, pernicious
or hurtful, shall and may burn, or otherwise
destroy, reporting the name of the offender to the
Master, Warden and Assistants, who may impose and
levy on such person the following fines; for the first
offence five pounds, for the second offence ten pounds,
and for the third and every other offence the sum of
twenty pounds. No person to be nominated to search
drugs, or chosen to the Court of Examiners within
the City of London, or thirty miles of the same, unless
he be a member of the Society of Apothecaries, of
not less than ten years standing; nor in any other
part of England and Wales, or to be one of the five
Apothecaries hereinafter mentioned, except he shall
have been an Apothecary in actual practice for not
less than ten years previously to his being so nominated
or appointed. “And whereas, it is the duty
of every Person using or exercising the art and
mystery of an apothecary, to prepare with exactness
and to dispense such medicines as may be directed
for the sick by any Physician, lawfully licensed to
practise Physic by the President and Commonalty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>of the Faculty of Physic in London, or by either
of the two Universities of Oxford or Cambridge;
therefore” if any person using the mystery of an
Apothecary shall refuse to compound or administer
or deliberately or negligently, falsely or unfaithfully
mix, compound, or administer any medicines ordered
by any lawful Physician by any prescription signed
with his initials, such person on complaint made
within twenty-one days by such Physician,<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c011'><sup>[125]</sup></a> and
upon conviction of such offence before any of his
Majesty’s Justices of the Peace, unless such offender
can shew some satisfactory reason, excuse, or justification
in this behalf, forfeit for the first offence five
pounds, for the second offence ten pounds, and for
the third offence he shall forfeit his certificate, and
be rendered incapable in future of using the art and
mystery of an apothecary and shall be deemed incapable
of receiving any fresh certificate until he shall
faithfully promise and undertake and give good and
sufficient security, that he will not in future be guilty
of the like offence.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c011'><sup>[126]</sup></a> The Master and Wardens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>may from time to time appoint deputies to act for
them. The Master, Wardens, and Society of Apothecaries
are appointed to carry this act into execution
throughout England and Wales, but no act of the
Master, Wardens, &amp;c. shall be valid (except the
search of drugs, &amp;c. as before mentioned, the acts of
the Court of Examiners, and of the five Apothecaries
hereinafter mentioned) unless the same be done at
some meeting to be holden in the hall of the Society.
The powers granted to the Master, Wardens and
Society, to be exercised by the Master, Wardens and
Assistants for the time being, or the major part of
them present; the number present at such assemblies
not to be less than thirteen, of which the Master must
be one. Twelve persons properly qualified shall
be chosen and appointed by the Master, Wardens
and Assistants (who may also remove or displace them
from time to time as they may deem advisable) and
such twelve persons, or any seven of them, shall be
and be called the Court of Examiners of the Society
of Apothecaries and shall have full power to examine
all Apothecaries and Assistants to Apothecaries
throughout England and Wales, and to grant or
refuse certificates; this Court is to meet once a week
at the Halls, a chairman to be appointed who in case
of equality (his own vote included) shall have a casting
vote. The Master, Wardens or Court of Assistants
are to administer a prescribed oath of office<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c011'><sup>[127]</sup></a> to the
Examiners. The Examiners remain in office one
year (except in cases of removal) and may be reappointed;
in case of death the successor remains in
office only to such time as his predecessor would
have done. After the fifth of August, 1815, it shall
not be lawful for any person (except persons already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>in practice) to practise as an Apothecary in any part
of England or Wales, unless he shall have been
examined by the said Court of Examiners and have
received a certificate of his being duly qualified to
practise as such; no person to be admitted to examination
until he shall have attained the full age of
twenty-one years, nor unless he shall have served
an apprenticeship of not less than five years to an
Apothecary and shall produce testimonials to the
satisfaction of the Court of Examiners, of a sufficient
medical education and of a good moral conduct.
Persons intending to qualify are to give notice to the
Clerk. It shall not be lawful for any person (except
persons then acting as Assistants and except persons
who have actually served an apprenticeship of five
years<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c011'><sup>[128]</sup></a> to an Apothecary) to act as Assistant to
any Apothecary in compounding or dispensing medicines
without undergoing an examination by the
Court of Examiners (or by five Apothecaries hereinafter
mentioned) and obtaining a certificate of his
qualifications. The Master and Wardens or Court
of Examiners may from time to time appoint Five
Apothecaries<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c011'><sup>[129]</sup></a> in any county throughout England
and Wales (except within the city of London and
thirty miles circuit) to act for such county in examining
Apothecaries and their Assistants, for which
purpose they shall hold monthly meetings in the
county town, three to be a quorum and the Chairman
in case of equality to have a casting vote. The sums
to be paid for Certificates to be as follows; Ten
pounds ten shillings to be paid to the Master, Wardens,
&amp;c. for Certificate to practise within London
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>or ten miles circuit, and Six pounds six shillings for
any other part of England or Wales, in which case
the Certificate may be afterwards enlarged to London,
&amp;c. on payment of Four pounds four shillings.
Any person practising (except persons in actual practice
as before mentioned) without a Certificate shall
for every such offence forfeit Twenty pounds, and
Assistants (except as aforesaid) Five pounds. And
no Apothecary shall be allowed to recover any charges
claimed by him in any court of law, unless he
shall prove that he was in practice on or before the
first of August 1815, or that he has obtained his Certificate.
Persons refused a Certificate to practise
may apply again.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c011'><sup>[130]</sup></a> The Master, Wardens, &amp;c. are
to publish an annual list of all persons who in that
year have obtained Certificates. The monies arising
from Certificates to be at the disposal of the Master,
Wardens, &amp;c.; the penalties, one half to the informer
and one half to the Master, Wardens, &amp;c.
Fines and penalties above Five pounds to be recovered
by action at law in the name of the Master,
Wardens and Society of the art and mystery of Apothecaries
of the city of London; and if the fine or
penalty be less than Five pounds, then the same shall
be levied by distress warrant under the hand and seal
of any Justice of the Peace acting for the city, county,
town, or place where the offence was committed;
and the distress is not to be held unlawful for want
of forms. But this act is not to affect chemists or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>druggists,<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c011'><sup>[131]</sup></a> nor in any way to interfere with, lessen,
prejudice or defeat any of the rights, authorities,
privileges and immunities of the two Universities of
Oxford and Cambridge, the Royal College of Physicians,
the Royal College of Surgeons, or the said
Society of Apothecaries. Actions against any Corporation
for any thing done under this act to be
brought within six months, and in the county in
which the dispute shall arise; defendants may plead
the general issue. The jury shall find for the defendants
if such action have been brought without twenty-one
days notice, and on verdict for the defendants or
the plaintiff suffering discontinuance or nonsuit, they
the defendants shall have double costs. This act to
be deemed a public act.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such is the general outline of the act under which
the Society of Apothecaries have obtained a very
considerable addition to their ancient powers (for the
act itself we refer the reader to the <i>Appendix</i>); we
are convinced that much public benefit may arise
from a diligent use and exertion of these authorities,
and from what we know of the parties now entrusted
with them, we do not anticipate any evil from the
mode or motives of their execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>We do not think it necessary to enter into the
details of the By-laws of this Society, nor into their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>character as a trading Corporation; we may however
remark that the quality of the medicines supplied by
them to the Navy and East India Company, has been
very generally approved; too much care cannot be
taken to secure the purity and propriety of the
assortments exported for the use of our gallant
defenders; nor is there any good reason why the
army should not be supplied under the same or a similar
system; we do not mean that the Apothecaries
Company should have an absolute monopoly of medicines
for the public service, for such a grant would
defeat the end proposed, but if under a fair and open
competition they can furnish the necessary supplies
of an equal quality and price with their rivals in
trade, there are reasons of public expediency which
would turn the scale in favor of a fixed and permanent
Corporation, in preference to the individuals however
respectable, whose trading may be more subject to
accidents and vacillations.</p>

<p class='c000'>We must not conclude our account of the Society
of Apothecaries, without noticing the splendid botanic
garden at Chelsea, which, for a period of a century
and a half, they have possessed and carefully maintained:
and it is worthy of remark, that this is the
only depository of exotic and indigenous plants, in the
vicinity of the metropolis, which belongs to any
public body. From the account of this establishment
by Mr. Field,<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c011'><sup>[132]</sup></a> its early history appears to be involved
in considerable obscurity; the company however
were mere lessees of the ground, until the fee
and inheritance of the estate, together with the manor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of Chelsea, was purchased from Lord Cheyne by Sir
Hans Sloane; when this distinguished naturalist and
physician, by deed, containing certain covenants<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c011'><sup>[133]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>hereafter mentioned, gave the society full possession
of, and a permanent interest in, the garden. The
society do not appear to have been insensible to
the liberal conduct of Sir Hans Sloane; a marble
statue of their benefactor, executed by Michael
Ryebrach, at the cost of £250, was erected by them
in 1737, and it remains as a lasting memorial of his
munificence, and of their gratitude.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>4 OF THE EXEMPTIONS AND LIABILITIES OF MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Physicians, Surgeons, and Apothecaries have been
exempted from the performance of various civil
duties by several Acts and Charters, and those exemptions
which were at first limited, have by custom
become so general, that they may now be considered
as legally established.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the 14 and 15 <i>Hen.</i> 8. <i>c.</i> 5. that part of the
Charter of the College of Physicians, which exempts
them from being summoned to or placed on any
assizes, juries, inquests, inquisitions, attaints, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et aliis
recognitionibus</span></i>, even in pursuance of the King’s writ,
is confirmed by Statute; and by the 32 <i>Hen.</i> 8. <i>c.</i> 40.
they, and as it may appear the Licenciates also,
(under the name of Commons,) are discharged from
keeping watch and ward, from serving the office of
constable,<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c011'><sup>[135]</sup></a> or any other office within the city of
London and the suburbs, any order, custom or law to
the contrary notwithstanding.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c011'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Corporation of the city of London, however,
appear to have been unwilling to acquiesce in these
exemptions, grounding themselves probably on their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>own Charters and Privileges, and on the reservation
of their rights in the concluding clause of the Charter
of the College. We find, therefore, that the members
of the College were frequently harassed by being
elected to parochial offices, and being called upon to
find arms, and to keep watch and ward.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1588, “Being then a time of most imminent
and public danger, the Lord Mayor of <i>London</i>
and Court of Aldermen charged the College with
arms, whereupon they applied themselves to Queen
<i>Elizabeth</i> and her Council; upon which Secretary
<i>Walsingham</i> wrote a letter to the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen of London, that they should no more
trouble the College, but permit them to live quietly,
and free from that charge. After this they met
with no further trouble or molestation till the
reign of King <i>James</i>; at which time the College
being charged with arms, Sir <i>William Paddy</i> pleaded
their privilege before Sir <i>Thomas Middleton</i>,
Lord Mayor, and a full Court of Aldermen, and
Sir <i>Henry Montague</i>, Recorder.” “The Recorder
then perusing every branch of the Statutes recited
by Sir <i>William Paddy</i>, with the reasons by him
urged; and opening every part thereof at large,
did conclude, that the Act of Parliament did extend
to give the College as much immunity as in any
sort to the Chirurgeons. Hereupon the Court desired
a list of the members of the College, which
was immediately given them, and an order entered
for a dispensation to the College from bearing of
arms; and also a precept was then awarded by
the Mayor and Court, to commit all other Physicians
or Surgeons, refusing to bear or find arms,
who were not of the College allowed, or Chirurgeons
licensed according to form.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“About three years after this debate, King <i>James</i>
granted the College his Royal Charter, wherein he
confirms all former statutes and patents given them
by his royal progenitors, and therein granted, To
all and every Physician of the College to be wholly
and absolutely free from providing or bearing of
any armour or other munition, &amp;c. any act or statute
to the contrary notwithstanding.”</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Charles</i> the Second also by his Charter granted the
same exemptions in very full terms, and sent a letter
to the Lord Mayor of London (for which see <i>Appendix</i>)
commanding the observance of these privileges.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thus by the especial grace and favour of the
Kings and Queens of <i>England</i>, the College of Physicians
have been freed from bearing and providing
arms: and though some particular member may
of late have been summoned upon that account by
the Lieutenancy, yet upon producing his Majesty’s
patent and asserting his Sovereign’s natural right
in dispensing with a Corporation of men from bearing
and providing arms, which was an inherent
prerogative in the Crown; and therefore an Act of
Parliament was made in 13 <i>Car.</i> 2. 6. positively
declaring, That the sole and supreme power, government,
command and disposition of all the
Militia, and of all forces by sea and land, &amp;c. is,
and by the laws of <i>England</i> ever was, the undoubted
right of his Majesty and his royal predecessors,
they were freed from any further trouble.
An instance of which we lately had in the case of
Dr. <i>Newell</i>, then candidate of the College of Physicians;
who, anno 1680, was summoned to appear
before the Lieutenancy of <i>London</i> for not bearing
and providing arms. Upon which summons, attending
with the Patent 15 <i>Car. Secundi Regis nunc</i>.”
The Lieutenancy on debate desired a copy of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>exempting part of the patent, that they might consult
with their counsel. On the next committee-day they
told him they were satisfied that the words of the
Patent were sufficient to exempt the members of the
College from bearing and providing arms, and desired
that a list of them might be given in under the
College Seal, which was accordingly done.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir <i>Francis Pemberton</i>, Sir <i>Edmund Saunders</i>, and
Mr. <i>Holt</i>, lawyers of whose celebrity it is unnecessary
to speak, being consulted on the same point,
answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir <i>F. P.</i> I conceive his Majesty may, by his Patent,
excuse the College from finding arms if he think
fit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir <i>E. S.</i> The Patent doth discharge the Physicians
from bearing or providing of arms, notwithstanding
the Militia Act.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. <i>H.</i> I conceive by the Patent all the members
of the College are exempted from being at any charge
towards the Militia.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in the case of <i>Sir Hans Sloane</i> against Lord
<i>William Pawlett</i>, Lord Chief Justice <i>Parker</i> was of
opinion, that the King by his prerogative could not
dispense with an Act of Parliament which was made
for the public good of the whole nation; “but admitting
that he could exempt them (the Physicians)
from personal duties, yet it cannot be inferred from
thence, that he might exempt them from being contributory
to others to perform those duties which
are required by an Act of Parliament, especially
where the subject has an interest that such duties
should be performed, or a loss if they should not;
and the better opinion seemed to be that the King
could not exempt in such cases. That in the principal
case, the contribution to be made to the finding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>a man with arms to serve in <span class='sc'>The Militia</span>, is a
charge upon the lands, as well as on the persons of
the owners; and if this charter of exemption should
be good, it would encrease the charge on all the
lands of persons not exempted, which would be a
very great damage to such persons, because the
physicians who are exempted are a considerable
body of men in every county, for which reason it
would be very hard if the King had power to lessen
the tax imposed upon one man, and charge it on
another. Besides the King cannot exempt in any
case where the subject has an interest.” (See 8 <i>Mod.</i>
p. 11.) Therefore when it is intended to exempt
Medical practitioners from the burthen of any Militia
Act, it is necessary that they should be specifically
mentioned.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>OF ACTIONS BY MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A Physician cannot maintain an action for his fees,
for they are honorary, and not demandable of right;
“and it is much more for the credit and rank of that
body, (the physicians) and perhaps for their benefit
also that they should be so considered; and I much
doubt, says Lord <i>Kenyon</i>, whether they themselves
would not altogether disclaim such a right, as
would place them upon a less respectable footing in
society, than that which they at present hold.”
<i>Chorley</i> against <i>Bolcot</i>, 4 T. R. 317, <i>see Appendix</i>.
It was contended in this case, that there was no authority
in the books for placing physicians and barristers
fees<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c011'><sup>[137]</sup></a> on the same footing; the regulation
with regard to barristers being founded on grounds of
public policy, as appears by a passage in Tacitus to
which Mr. Justice <i>Blackstone</i> refers; in which passage
it is taken for granted that Medici<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c011'><sup>[138]</sup></a> were entitled
to a remuneration, because their situation was
dissimilar to that of advocates.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c011'><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>But though a physician cannot recover his fees by
process of law, yet <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro concilio impenso et impendendo</span></i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>is a good and valuable consideration for an
annuity; (9 Co. Rep. 50: 7 Co. Rep. 10. 28.) And
this was formerly a very frequent mode of remuneration
for professional services both in law and physic,
though at the present day it does not frequently occur.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a bond, bill, or note were given for medical attendance,
the consideration would be good, though
the original fees could not have been recovered. A
distinction might we think be drawn between the fees
of a physician and his travelling expenses, which are
frequently considerable; but the case of <i>Chorley</i> and
<i>Bolcot</i>, before cited, is against it.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a medical practitioner passes himself off as a
physician, (by no means an unfrequent practice in
distant parts of the country) although he has no diploma,
and no right to assume that character, he
cannot maintain an action for his fees. <i>Lipscombe v.
Holmes</i>, 2 <i>Camp.</i> 441. <i>see Appendix</i>. Though as a
surgeon he might have recovered compensation: and
even if he were no regular surgeon, the doctrine in
<i>Gremare v. Le Clerc Bois Valor</i>, 2 <i>Camp.</i> 144. would
entitle him to recover in an action of assumpsit. But
query the authority of this case.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c011'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>If there be any promise, a physician may receive on
a <i>quantum meruit, Shepherd v. Edwards</i>; <i>Hill</i> 11.
<i>Jac.</i> 2. <i>Croke</i> 370. In this case the plaintiff declared
that he being a professor of physic and surgery had
cured the defendant of a fistula and he had judgment.
All physicians may practise surgery; (32 <i>Hen.</i> 8.)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>though surgeons may not encroach in physic; therefore
query whether in this case the plaintiff did not
sue as a surgeon; and the disease was one which in
this day would clearly be classed as a surgical case.
It was not so however in <i>Dale</i> against <i>Copping</i>,
(<i>Bulst. part</i> 1. <i>p.</i> 39) when the promise of an infant
to pay a certain sum to the defendant for curing him
of the falling sickness was held binding, “for that
this shall be taken as a contract, and that to be for
a thing in the nature of necessity to be done for
him, and the same as necessary as if it had been a
promise by him made for his meat, drink, or apparel,
and in all such cases his promise is good and
shall bind him.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>OF ACTIONS AGAINST MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>If a Physician, Surgeon, Apothecary, or other
medical practitioner, undertakes the cure of any
wound or disease, and by neglect or ignorance the
party is not cured, or suffers materially in his health,
such medical attendant is liable to damages in an
action of trespass on the case: but the person must
be a <em>common Surgeon</em><a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c011'><sup>[141]</sup></a>, or one who makes public
profession of such business, as surgeon, apothecary,
&amp;c. for otherwise it was the plaintiff’s own folly to
trust to an unskilful person, unless such person
<em>expressly</em> undertook the cure, and then the action
may be maintained against him also. <i>See Bull.
N. P. p.</i> 73; 2 <i>Esp. N. P. p.</i> 601.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And it seems that any deviation from the established
mode of practice, shall be deemed sufficient
to charge the Surgeon, &amp;c. in case of any injury
arising to the patient.” <i>See Slater</i> v. <i>Baker and
Stapleton</i>. 2 <i>Wils.</i> 359. which was a special action on
the case against a Surgeon and an Apothecary, for
unskilfully disuniting the callous of the plaintiff’s leg
after it was set, (<i>see Appendix, p.</i> 189) which it appears
was done for the purpose of trying a new
instrument. The Plaintiff recovered 500<i>l.</i> against
the Defendants jointly, and the Chief Justice said he
was well satisfied with the verdict. On a motion for
a new trial, the judgment was affirmed by the whole
Court.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>In <i>Seare</i> against <i>Prentice</i>, 8 <i>East. R.</i> 348. it was
determined that this action lies against a Surgeon for
gross ignorance and want of skill in his profession,
as well as for negligence and carelessness, to the
detriment of a patient; though if the evidence be of
negligence only, which was properly left to the jury,
and negatived by them; the Court will not grant a
new trial, because the jury were directed that want
of skill alone would not sustain the action. <i>See Appendix,
p.</i> 194.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the case of <i>Neale</i> v. <i>Pettigrew</i>, a Surgeon was
held responsible in damages for the negligence and
unskilfulness of his apprentice or servant<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c011'><sup>[142]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the cited cases are surgical, there is no
doubt that similar actions would be maintainable
against Physicians or other medical practitioners;
but as internal injuries are less demonstrable than
external, there might be some difficulty in obtaining
the necessary evidence. We shall treat in another
place of the criminal responsibility of persons undertaking
cures in cases where death ensues from their
mal-practice.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>MIDWIFERY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“In former times the necessity of Baptism to new
born infants was so rigorously taught, that for this
reason they allowed lay people and even women,
to baptize the declining child, where a priest could
not be immediately found; so fondly superstitious
in this matter, that in hard labours the head of the
infant was sometimes baptized before the whole
delivery; this office of baptizing in such cases of
necessity was commonly performed by the midwife;
and tis very probable, this gave first occasion to
midwives being licensed by the bishop, because
they were to be first examined by the bishop or his
delegated officer, whether they could repeat the form
of baptism which they were in haste to administer
upon such extraordinary occasions. But we thank
God our times are reformed in sense and in religion.”
(<i>Watson’s Cler. Law, c.</i> 31, <i>p.</i> 318.) The concluding
sentence appears to be somewhat ill placed,
for a few lines before the reverend author says, “And
<i>Note</i>, that a child baptized with water in the name of
the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
is sufficiently baptized, although not baptized by a
lawful priest, as may be collected from the Rubrick;
and so it is if the child be baptized by other form,
yet the person baptizing not being a lawful priest
is punishable, like as a lawful priest baptizing by
other form than is set down by the Book of Common
Prayer is punishable;” and a few lines after, he says,
that a Clergyman “ought not to bury the corps of
any person dying unbaptized:” surely if the baptism
of a child by a lay person is good, and the body
cannot have Christian Burial without it, there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>nothing senseless or irreligious, and we will venture
to add nothing morally or legally wrong, in the
performance of this provisional ceremony. If there
were no other object than to satisfy the anxiety of
the mother at a moment when the calmness of her
feelings is vitally important, it ought not to be
omitted whenever the danger of the child and the
absence of a priest appear to render it necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Burn</i> says, “By several constitutions, the minister
was required frequently to instruct the people, in
the form of words to be used in such cases of
necessity,” (2 <i>Burn’s Ecc. Law</i>, p. 469,) and the
oath administered by the bishops to licensed midwives,
(<i>See Appx.</i> 160,) though, it does not command, implies
that baptism may be administered by other than a
priest. “You shall not be privy, or consent that
any priest or <em>other</em> party shall in your absence or in
your company, or of your knowledge or sufferance
baptize any child by any mass, latin service or
prayers, than such as are appointed by the laws
of the Church of England:” here the prohibition is
to the form not the person.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever may have been the origin of the bishop’s
license, his jurisdiction does not appear to have been
sanctioned by the law. “If there be a suit in the
Spiritual Court against a woman for exercising
the trade of a midwife without license of the
Ordinary, against the Canons, a prohibition lieth:
for this is not any spiritual function, of which they
have cognisance. <i>Buskin</i> and <i>Cripes</i>, Tr. 9, Ch.
BR and a prohibition was granted accordingly.”
(2 <i>Roll Abr.</i> 286. 2 <i>Burn, Ecc. Law, Tit. Midwife</i>.)</p>

<p class='c000'>In the reign of Charles the first, a Doctor of Physic
attempted a project to procure the sole and absolute
power, either to license or approve of all the midwives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>practising in and about <i>London</i>, before their
admittance; they presented a petition to the President
and College of Physicians, (for which see
Goodall’s Pro. 463,) in which it appears that a
petition on the same subject having been presented
to the King, his Majesty referred the same to the
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury and Bishop of London,
in whose jurisdictions and by whose authority, it is
stated, that they had always been licensed; the
object of the petition to the College, was to obtain
their certificate of the competent skill of the petitioners,
for which purpose they alleged that other
practisers in midwifery had been examined upon the
like occasion, by command from King James; the
physicians by their answer, (<i>for which see Appendix</i>)
discouraged the scheme of the would-be licencer, and
the matter thereupon appears to have been dropped.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have before noticed, that there is some probability
that both the College of Physicians and the
College of Surgeons will decline all future interference
with this branch; if so, it will be necessary
that some new authority should be instituted for the
purpose of examining and licensing candidates for
practice; the duty to be performed is by far too
dangerous and delicate to be left to the hands of any
who would assume it; yet such is at present the case,
and not without fatal examples of the errors and
imperfections of our lego-medical system.</p>

<p class='c000'>We do not of course include in this censure, the
private Institutions for the instruction of midwives,
in which the want of a public provision is endeavoured
to be compensated; but the operation of such societies
must be of necessity very limited and utterly inadequate,
not only to the demands of the empire, but to
the magnitude of the metropolis.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>OF THE PRESERVATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>There is not in England, as in most countries of
the continent, a separate code or system of laws for
the preservation of the public health; actual nuisances,
of which we shall treat under a separate head,
are provided against by liability to indictment or
action at the information or suit of the parties immediately
interested; but except in the enforcement of
the Quarantine laws for the prevention of foreign
infection, the executive government takes little or no
part in securing the bodily health of its subjects. The
habits of order and cleanliness, for which the inhabitants
of our island are celebrated, and the general
salubrity of our climate, may have rendered such care
less necessary; while our spirit of liberty and independence
might have resisted the encroachments on
domestic privacy, and the perpetual intrusion of local
authorities, to which our neighbours are subjected.
Except in extreme cases we are far from wishing any
change; but as there are situations and circumstances,
in populous towns, among the lowest order
of the people, and in times of contagious or epidemic
sickness, in which absolute apathy may be attended
with danger, we may be allowed to hint that some
prospective enactment would be more politic, than
to be obliged to legislate for the evil when its mischiefs
had been accomplished. This has been already
done as respects Ireland by the statute 59th <i>Geo.</i> 3.
<i>c.</i> 41. (<i>see Appendix</i>,) by which it is enacted that
Officers of Health should be appointed annually,
at vestries of the inhabitants in every city and large
town, where the Lord Lieutenant or chief Governor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>shall think fit to direct.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c011'><sup>[143]</sup></a> Something of this kind
might be advantageously extended to the whole of
the United Kingdom.</p>

<p class='c000'>In former times, however, when from the comparatively
uncultivated state of the people, contagious
diseases were more common, there were several laws
and regulations on this head, which have now fallen
into disuse. Many cities have still some relics of
their Lazar-house, situated at some distance without
the walls;<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c011'><sup>[144]</sup></a> and there was also an ancient writ
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Leproso amovendo</span></i>, to remove a leper or lazar
who thrust himself into the company of his neighbours
in any parish, either in the church, or at other
public meetings, to their annoyance. <i>Reg. Orig.</i> 237.
By the 1st <i>James, c.</i> 31. (now expired) it was made
felony if any one having a Plague sore running upon
him goes abroad, 1 <i>Hale, P. C.</i> 432.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c011'><sup>[145]</sup></a> And to this
day it is an indictable offence for any person to pass
through the streets, or cause others to pass through
the streets, even for medical advice, while they have
the Smallpox upon them.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c011'><sup>[146]</sup></a> Previous to the important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>discovery of Vaccination, this law would
have been attended with very considerable hardship;
as it precluded the patient from the best remedy for
the disorder—exposure to fresh air; yet there can be
no doubt that in this as in all other cases, individual
interest must yield to general policy. Had the rule
been more carefully attended to, many of the pests
to which human nature is subject, might have been
checked or even extirpated in the commencement of
their progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is one disorder, to check the propagation of
which has been singularly neglected, under the curious
pretence that any regulation would be an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>encouragement to immorality; we cannot assent to
the validity of this objection, and think that we should
find little difficulty in refuting it. But the disease is
undoubtedly on the decline both as to its frequency
and its virulence.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c011'><sup>[147]</sup></a> The superior mode of medical
treatment, by which many cases are arrested in the
earliest stage, may have tended greatly to this effect;
but we are inclined to attach yet greater importance
to a change of habit in the upper and middle classes
of society. The mode of life handed down to us by
the poets, dramatists, novelists, and essayists from
<i>Charles</i> to <i>George</i> the second, unhappily confirmed
by the criminal records of the same period, has no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>existence in modern manners: drunkenness is no
longer a fashionable vice; the tavern parties, which
even <i>Addison</i> did not blush to describe, no longer
disgrace us. From these social improvements, and
from increased habits of cleanliness, we may deduce
the milder form and more unfrequent occurrence of
the disease, which poisons human life at its source.
Still we feel some astonishment that the change has
not been forwarded by a measure of the police;
for though a Parisian system might savour somewhat
too much of our own ancient abuses,<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c011'><sup>[148]</sup></a> yet it would
neither be difficult or immoral for the magistrates,
when they occasionally clear the streets for the night,
to order the detention of those whose liberty might,
on surgical examination, prove dangerous to the unwary;
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">obsta principiis</span></i> is as good a maxim in law as
in physic. One Surgeon attached to each police
office, for this, and other evident purposes, would
be materially useful and not considerably expensive.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have observed in another place<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c011'><sup>[149]</sup></a> on the
attention necessary to be directed to prison discipline,
as it respects the health of criminal or unfortunate
prisoners; but the subject is so much before the
public on this and other points, that we do not think
it necessary to enlarge upon it here. It is not so,
however, in other cases to which legislative attention
might be advantageously directed. Sir <i>Robert Peel’s</i>
Bill for regulating the working hours of children in
the cotton factories, might in some of its enactments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>be safely extended to many other branches of trade,
more especially when contagious diseases are found
to exist in large collections of people confined to a
very small space. This observation applies also to
infectious diseases breaking out in schools; at present
the discretion of the master is the only security
to the public: in the higher class we have no doubt
that this discretion is well exercised; but there are
others where, gain being the only object, the speculator
will rather risk the lives of the unfortunate
children committed to his charge, than the chance of
their being permanently removed from his precarious
protection.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c011'><sup>[150]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>We are well aware that any adequate remedy for
these evils would require the most serious attention
of the most experienced ability; but because the task
is difficult, we do not think it impracticable; and
where human life, in its most interesting and useful
forms is at stake, we are assured that labour, however
thankless in its outset, will ultimately meet its
reward in the approval of society.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having thus ventured to suggest some measures
which seem calculated to secure and promote the
public health, we may be allowed to glance at the impolicy
of any tax which has a tendency to deprive
the lower orders of those articles which are essential
to it; the salt duties immediately suggest themselves
as a lamentable instance of such impolicy: salt
is to the poor an indispensable part of their diet;
it is essential to their bodily health, to the preservation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>or composition of bread, butter, cheese, meat,
fish, and almost every article of their food, and its
utility is always greater in proportion to the scantiness,
and nutritive deficiency of their diet.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c011'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The importance of cleanliness in cities, and of
purity in the waters by which they are supplied,
will more properly fall under consideration in another
division of our subject; but we may here generally
observe, that no circumstance contributes in a
greater degree to the public health than an attention
to this branch of medical jurisprudence. The deleterious
influence of stagnant waters is too apparent
to admit controversy, in which are to be included
moats, where the water has no motion, and meadows
which are occasionally overflowed; it has accordingly
been the policy of every enlightened country to provide
adequate resources for its drainage, and those
liberal individuals who have encouraged the plans
for its accomplishment have ever been distinguished
by the gratitude of the people. It has been conjectured,
and not without probability, that the patriotism
of <i>Marcus Curtius</i> is thus handed down to us
in a figurative allusion, and that he probably filled
up, at his own cost, some stagnant pools which affected
the health of his fellow citizens. <i>Empedocles</i>, a
disciple of <i>Pythagoras</i>, delivered the Salentines from
the dangerous exhalations with which they were infested,
by conducting two neighbouring rivers through
their marshes, by which the stagnant waters were carried
off; the air was therefore no longer infected, and
the diseases which had flowed from this source immediately
subsided. In ancient Rome, the physical
evils which have since so materially contributed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>deprive it of its former salubrity and splendour, were
obviated by magnificent aqueducts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The slaughtering of cattle is another very important
object in relation to the public health of a
great city, and we cannot but wish that some police
regulations were established that might mitigate the
serious evils so often experienced from this circumstance,
in most of the large towns of the British
empire.</p>

<p class='c000'>There still remains to be noticed one practice
connected with the public health, that requires
some animadversion from the medical jurist—<span class='sc'>The
Burial of the Dead in the midst of populous
towns and cities.</span>—It is certainly extraordinary
that a country which has long abjured the errors of
the church of Rome, should still retain one of its
most absurd <a id='super'></a>superstitions, yet such is the fact in
England, as it respects the Burial of the Dead in
churches, and church-yards, and in cemeteries, situated
in the very heart of our most populous cities.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c011'><sup>[152]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>If the health of the people be a primary object of
legislation, there is no point which in the present
advanced state of population calls more imperiously
for its interference; the cemeteries of the metropolis
are so crowded<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c011'><sup>[153]</sup></a> that it becomes more difficult to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>find room for the dead than the living, and yet free
as we boast ourselves to be from the prejudices and
superstitions of our ancestors, we question whether
there is any point upon which more popular clamour
would be raised than that of changing the system of
burial. It is difficult, in the first place, to overcome
those feelings which originate in a principle amiable
and useful in itself, however mistaken it may be in
its practical applications. Nature appears to have
implanted in all mankind a sentiment of veneration
for the mortal remains of those whom living we have
loved or respected; every nation, whether civilized
or barbarous, has accordingly invented and practised
some ceremony,<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c011'><sup>[154]</sup></a> generally of a religious character,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>in the final disposal of the human corpse; it is however
the duty of the state to guard the living from
those evils to which an ill applied respect for the
dead may be likely to subject them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although we are disposed to admit with <i>Diemerbroeck</i><a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c011'><sup>[155]</sup></a>
and Dr. <i>Bancroft</i>,<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c011'><sup>[156]</sup></a> that the effluvia which
issue from putrefying human bodies are not capable
of generating the specific contagious matter of Plague,
Typhus, or any true pestilential fever, yet, but little
reflection is necessary to lead any reasoning mind to
the conclusion, that in the decomposition of the human
body various noxious principles are developed
highly injurious to human life. Dr. <i>Bancroft</i>, in order
to establish his position respecting the non-pestilential
nature of these effluvia, relates two instances of
extensive exhumations, which he says furnish facts on
so large a scale as completely, in his opinion, to decide
the question. The first relates to those made in
the church-yard of <i>St. Eloi</i>, at Dunkirk, in the year
1783; and the other to those made three years afterwards,
in the famous cemetrie of the <i>Saint Innocens</i>,
at Paris. As the operations and results were similar
in both instances, it will be sufficient if we describe
only the latter. The church-yard of the Saint Innocens,
situated in one of the most populous quarters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>of the city of Paris, had been made the depository of
so many bodies, that, although its area enclosed near
two acres of ground, yet the soil had been raised by
them eight or ten feet higher than the level of the
adjoining streets: and upon the most moderate calculation,
considerably more than six hundred thousand
bodies had been buried in it, during the last six
centuries: previous to which date, it was already a
very ancient burial ground;<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c011'><sup>[157]</sup></a> numerous complaints
having been made concerning the offensive smells
which arose from this spot, and had penetrated into the
houses, and the deleterious effects which such emanations
produced, having been described in a memoir
read before the Royal Academy of Sciences<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c011'><sup>[158]</sup></a> in 1783,
by <i>M. Cadet de Vaux</i>, who held the useful office of
<i>Inspecteur Général des objects de Salubrité</i>, the Council
of State decreed in 1785 that so much of the superstratum
should be removed as would reduce the surface
to the level of the streets. This work was accordingly
undertaken in 1786, under the superintendance
of <i>M. Thouret</i>, a Physician of eminence in Paris,<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c011'><sup>[159]</sup></a>
and in two years he accomplished it. It does
not appear that any epidemic evils were experienced
from these extensive exhumations, but it must be remembered
that the great mass of bodies had been
converted into a harmless and inoffensive substance
resembling spermaceti, to which the name of <i>Adipocire</i><a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c011'><sup>[160]</sup></a>
has been given; had this change not occurred,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>it is more than probable that worse consequences
would have been experienced from this horrible accumulation:
sufficient instances however occurred to
prove the dangerous tendency of the mephitic vapours<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c011'><sup>[161]</sup></a>
which were emitted; grave-diggers were
thrown down suddenly, and deprived of sense and
motion, upon breaking open, by their spades, the abdominal
viscera; these vapours also, in a more diffused
state, produced nausea, loss of appetite, and
in the course of time, paleness of countenance, debility,
tremors, &amp;c. If farther evidence be required
upon this subject, we have only to direct the reader’s
attention to the effects occasioned by opening the
graves in St. Dennis, and to which no allusion is
made by <i>Dr. Bancroft</i>: the National Convention in the
year 1793, in the true spirit of revolutionary ferocity,
passed a decree upon the motion of <i>Barrère</i>, that the
monuments of the Kings in this, as well as in all other
places throughout France, should be destroyed. In
carrying this decree into effect, the bodies of many of
the latter Bourbons were found in a state of decomposition,
and when the coffins were opened they are
said to have emitted a thick black vapour, which, although
vinegar and gunpowder were burnt to prevent
ill consequences, affected the wretches employed in
this inhuman work with fevers and diarrhæas: so
again when the ground of the church of St. Benoit
was dug up a few years ago, a nauseous vapour was
emitted, and several of the neighbours were affected
by it.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c011'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>We are nevertheless far from believing that such
cadaverous impurities, however unwholesome, are
capable of generating the specific contagions of Typhus,
&amp;c.; nor are we even inclined to assent to that
general opinion which supposes that putrid emanations
from the bodies of persons who have died of a
pestilential disorder are capable of re-exciting the
disease, and we are fortified in this conclusion by the
powerful testimony of <i>Mr. Howard</i>.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c011'><sup>[163]</sup></a> We ought
not, however, to omit to state, that instances are on
record, where the small-pox has suddenly appeared
in a village, after opening the grave of a person who
had a few months before fell a sacrifice to that disorder.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the experiments and observations which have
been made with respect to the decomposition of animal
bodies that are interred in burying-grounds, it
appears that they are, in such situations, subjected
to very different laws of decomposition, from those
which take place in bodies exposed to the open air.
In the former case no danger can attend the operation
provided the body be buried at a sufficient depth, and
that the grave be not opened before its entire and
complete decomposition. The depth of the grave
ought to be such that the external air cannot penetrate
it; that the juices with which the earth is impregnated
may be conveyed to its surface, and that
the exhalations, vapours, or gases, which are developed
or formed by decomposition, should not be capable
of forcing the earthy covering which detains
them. The nature of the earth in which the grave is
dug, influences all its effects. If the stratum which
covers the body be argillaceous, the depth of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>grave may be less, as this earth affords with difficulty
a passage to any gas or vapour; but, as a general
rule it may be admitted, that bodies should be buried
at the depth of five feet, to prevent any unpleasant
consequences. It is also important to remember that
the decomposition of the soft parts, according to <i>Mr.
Petit</i>, is not terminated until the expiration of three
years, in graves of four feet deep; or four years when
their depth is six feet. This term, of course, is
stated as a medium; it must necessarily vary according
to the nature of the soil, and the constitution of
the subjects buried in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A knowledge of these facts ought to lead to a more
rational system of interment. We can scarcely expect
to see the fulfilment of the wish expressed by
Evelyn in his <i>Sylva</i>, the establishment of a <i>Necropolis</i>
without the walls; but much may be effected by
judicious regulations; and the law will uphold any
parochial officer in the conscientious discharge of the
requisite duties; in certain cases it invests him with
a considerable latitude of discretion; thus when a
body is brought to be buried “it seemeth to be discretionary
in the minister whether the corpse shall be
carried into the church or not, and there may be
good reason for this, especially in cases of infection.”<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c011'><sup>[164]</sup></a>
A curious controversy has lately taken
place upon the introduction of iron coffins, and chemists
have differed widely upon the subject of their
relative durability, when compared with those of
wood. Sir <i>William Scott</i> (now Lord <i>Stowell</i>) decided,
and we think very justly, that under ordinary
circumstances the former appear less perishable, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>therefore when admitted into burying-grounds, that
the parties are to be held liable to extraordinary fees.</p>

<p class='c000'>Burial must not be delayed or denied, (<i>Lindwood</i>
278) nor hindered for debt,<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c011'><sup>[165]</sup></a> (<i>Burn Ec. L.</i> 238)
nor disturbed for purposes of dissection (<i>King v.
Lynn, vide Post.</i>) Formerly by 30 C. 2, st. 1, c. 3,
all bodies were directed to be buried in woollen,
under the penalty of £10; this enactment, which was
made with the idea of encouraging the woollen
trade, is now repealed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In relation to their effects upon the public health,
the arrangement and cleansing of privies deserve
some notice in this place. It has been long admitted
that the effluvia which issue from these receptacles of
human ordure are highly deleterious, and have been
known to occasion a species of ophthalmia, diarrhæa,
and dysentery, while in a more concentrated form
these emanations have proved suddenly fatal,<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c011'><sup>[166]</sup></a> by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>producing an affection named by the French Nosologists<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c011'><sup>[167]</sup></a>
the <i>Plomb</i>, or the Asphyxia of privies. <i>M.
Dupuytren</i> has given us many particulars respecting
this affection; sometimes the patients are strongly
asphyxied, and death takes place in a very short period;
at others, the symptoms are less intense, and
if the patients be carried into the open air, after a
short interval, they make deep inspirations, and the
breathing is gradually restored, although it continues
laborious; the motion of the heart becomes perceptible,
nevertheless the pulse is weak and small; the
digestive and loco-motive apparatus have lost their
contractile force; the functions of the brain are suspended;
and if the patient finally recovers, he is a
long time in re-establishing his strength. An emetic
appears to be the remedy upon which the <em>nightmen</em>
rely for relief.</p>

<p class='c000'>The above observations are sufficient to shew the
propriety of placing these establishments under police
regulations, especially where the deleterious influence
of their emanations are more decidedly remarkable,
as in hospitals, prisons, and barracks. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>governments of different countries have sought to
prevent the evil, by various laws, edicts, and ordinances.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c011'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In this country, we apprehend their supervision
belongs to the very ancient and extensive jurisdiction
of the Commissioners of Sewers,<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c011'><sup>[169]</sup></a> who although
not engaged like the Œdiles of ancient Rome, in
superintending magnificent aqueducts, are occupied
in directing the far more stupendous and wonderful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>works which extend beneath the foundations of our
mighty city, and dispense to its inhabitants the essential
requisites for comfort, cleanliness, and health.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>OF QUARANTINE, LAZARETTOS, AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS OF PLAGUE POLICE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The histories of different ages and countries furnish
numerous records of the occasional prevalence of certain
diseases, generally of the febrile class, which at
one period have occasioned the most destructive mortality,
while at others, they have assumed so mild a
form as to have affected only few, and to have destroyed
scarcely any of the population. Such diseases,
when they attack a great number of individuals about
the same time, or in rapid succession, are very properly
designated by the term <span class='sc'>Epidemic</span> (from επὶ
<em>upon</em> and δημος <em>the people</em>) and whenever their course
is attended with considerable mortality, they are
moreover said to be <em>Pestilential</em>. No fact in the history
of medicine has been the subject of more general
and anxious enquiry, or of more keen controversy,
than that of the origin of Epidemic diseases, and of
the immediate cause of their propagation and decline;
and although the field has been industriously explored
by the most able and experienced philosophers
and physicians, the subject still remains involved in
considerable obscurity; indeed, such different and
even opposite views have been entertained upon the
question, that writers have not even agreed upon the
exact import of the terms employed in their descriptions,
but each author appears to have acknowledged
a latitude of acceptation according to the particular
theory which he has been anxious to support. The
term <span class='sc'>Epidemic</span> ought in strictness to signify a disease
which, as we have before stated, attacks numbers
at or nearly the same time, without any reference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>to the cause from which it may have originated, or
be diffused; but this construction has been considerably
limited by many writers, who have applied it,
exclusively, to denote those maladies which derive
their origin solely from a noxious state of the atmosphere,
and which are incapable of being communicated
from one person to another; distinguishing
diseases of the latter kind by the epithet <em>Contagious</em>.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c011'><sup>[170]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A similar ambiguity involves the terms <span class='sc'>Contagion</span>
and <span class='sc'>Infection</span>, which are regarded by many authors
as synonymous and convertible expressions, signifying
the matter or medium by which certain diseases are
communicated from one individual to another; while
others, on the contrary, confine the term <em>Contagion</em>,
as its etymology would suggest (<i>con</i> and <i>tango</i>) to the
communication of those diseases, which can only be
transferred by actual contact of the sick, or of the
palpable matter from their bodies; and apply the
term <span class='sc'>Infection</span> to the communication of those other
diseases which spread by means of invisible effluvia.
Now we would observe in the first place, that according
to the most correct rules of philology, the import
of words is not necessarily to be deduced from their
derivation, but frequently to be either assumed conventionally
according to a definition, or to be adhered
to in the sense affixed to it by established
usage; in the next place, the distinction which the
etymologist would thus establish between the terms
<em>Contagion</em> and <em>Infection</em> is not accurate, for in every
case of infection, there is an actual contact of morbific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>matter, whether visible or not, and some diseases,
as the <em>Small-pox</em>, are communicated both by
palpable matter and by imperceptible effluvia.<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c011'><sup>[171]</sup></a>
Our best writers<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c011'><sup>[172]</sup></a> have therefore agreed to consider
the word <em>Contagion</em> as expressing the morbid
poison, or the means of transferring a disease, and
<em>Infection</em> as denoting the operation of the poison,
or the act of communication of the disease. Dr.
<i>Hancock</i><a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c011'><sup>[173]</sup></a> very justly observes that in almost all
the best Latin writers on medicine, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contagium</span></i>, and
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contagio</span></i> are the only words used to denote the effluvia,
or emanations arising in disease, which are capable
of infecting the sound, whether <em>mediately</em> by the
air, or by infected goods called <i>Fomites</i>, or <em>immediately</em>
by the touch: to limit contagion therefore to the
propagation of disease by contact only, would be to
disallow the more comprehensive use of the term in
our best authors.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those diseases which occur among the inhabitants
of a particular region or place, are said to be <span class='sc'>Endemic</span>,
or <span class='sc'>Endemial</span>; thus <em>Intermittent</em>, and <em>Remittent</em>
fevers, which are occasioned by the miasmata of marshy
grounds are <em>Endemic</em> in low countries: the <i>Goitre</i>,
or bronchocele, connected with that peculiar intellectual
imbecility which characterises the <span class='sc'>Cretin</span>, is
<span class='sc'>Endemic</span> among the Alps; in these instances, some
<em>local</em> cause obviously exists which produces the disease
in the respective districts: the disease therefore
belongs to the districts, and affects those that reside
there, but extends no farther; and hence the distinction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>between <em>Endemic</em> and <em>Epidemic</em> diseases is obvious
and important.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having thus determined the value and signification
of the terms, as used by different authors, and which
must necessarily be introduced on the present occasion,
we come to the consideration of that momentous
question, which has excited so keen an interest in the
political, mercantile, and medical circles of the present
age, and which has been farther heightened by
the late reference of the subject to the Legislature—<span class='sc'>Whether
Epidemical diseases be ever propagated
by Contagion?</span>——It is impossible to
imagine a question of deeper importance; it not only
involves the general safety of mankind, but is intimately
connected with the commercial welfare of
nations; for, as it has been truly observed, if these
diseases be not contagious, Quarantine laws are absurd,
and commerce needlessly burthened: the establishment
of lines of circumvallation, guarded by
cordons of troops, and the appointment of armed
police to confine the diseased to their habitations,
among their yet uninjured friends and relatives, are
perverse and barbarous regulations, and the fears
thus unnecessarily induced are as dangerous to the
community as they are pernicious in their effects to
the common feelings of humanity. But, on the other
hand, if the doctrine be true to the extent our most
accurate observers have deliberately reported, municipal
restraints cannot be too rigidly enforced, nor
can the conduct of those speculative theorists be too
severely reprehended, who, by lulling the ignorant
and unwary into false notions of security, not only
deprive them of the obvious means of safety, but render
them even the intermediate agents of disease and
death, to their families and neighbours.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>The term <span class='sc'>Plague</span> has been applied to various epidemical
diseases attended with great mortality; and
we find in the Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, Latin, and in
all the other ancient languages with which we are
acquainted, words having a corresponding import, and
signifying, generally, an extensive and destroying malady.
It appears, however, that these raging epidemics
have consisted of different maladies in different
instances, having been sometimes the <i>Remittent Fever</i>
originating from marsh effluvia, and sometimes the
true <i>Plague</i>, modified by circumstances and situations:
even in our own times some doubt has existed
respecting the true nature of the different pestilences
which have raged in Europe.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c011'><sup>[174]</sup></a> The term <span class='sc'>Plague</span>
is now more correctly limited in its acceptation, and
it is exclusively understood to denote “<em>a contagious
and malignant fever, which is accompanied by buboes
and carbuncles</em>.”<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c011'><sup>[175]</sup></a> As the nature of maladies of
high degree virtually includes that of all minor affections,
the Plague, in its relations to the doctrine of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Contagion, may on this occasion be considered as the
representative of every species of Typhus; while for
the same reason the Pestilential Epidemic which is
generally known by the name of the <span class='sc'>Yellow Fever</span>
may be regarded as including in its history all the
subordinate varieties of <i>Bilious Remittents</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is scarcely necessary to observe that it would be
as foreign to the object of this work, as incompatible
with the plan of its execution, to enter into any historical
details upon the subject of Pestilence, or upon
the controversies which have been carried on respecting
the manner in which Epidemics are propagated;
nor is such a review now required to complete the
medical literature of the subject; for Dr. <i>Hancock</i><a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c011'><sup>[176]</sup></a>
has lately supplied the chasm by a very able critical
examination of the principal writers which have appeared
at different times on the subject of Epidemic
and Pestilential diseases, and to this work we beg to
direct the reader’s attention, although as medical
Jurists we are not disposed to concur in those half
measures of <i>Quarantine</i> which the result of his researches
might incline some to adopt. We may state
in general terms, that the concurrent testimony of
different ages and countries sanctions the opinion that
Plague arises from specific contagion—is communicated
<em>immediately</em> by contact,<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c011'><sup>[177]</sup></a> or <em>mediately</em> by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>agency of infected goods<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c011'><sup>[178]</sup></a> (<i>Fomites</i>); and that its
progress may be arrested by a vigilant system of
Police, cutting off every communication between the
infected and the healthy. The contagious nature of
Plague has however been denied, and many thousand
lives have paid the forfeit of the delusion; it
was thus during the Plague of Marseilles in 1720,
that in consequence of the physicians in Paris having
decided against its contagious nature, a plan, in conformity
with that opinion was adopted in the treatment
of the sick, and <em>Sixty Thousand</em> people fell
victims to the disease in the space of seven months.
A similar prepossession induced the faculty of Sicily
to declare the Plague which ravaged Messina in 1743,
<em>not</em> to be contagious, but the loss of <em>Forty-three
Thousand</em> lives gave a practical refutation to the
hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c000'>In our own times, a work characterised by singular
arrogance and sophistry, has appeared from the
pen of Dr. <i>Charles Maclean</i>,<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c011'><sup>[179]</sup></a> the object of which
is to shew that “a belief in the contagious nature of
the Plague constitutes one of the most destructive
errors in the whole circle of human opinions;” in
the very commencement of this work he betrays an
ignorance which is not uncommonly associated with
that species of unbecoming confidence, which so
strikingly characterises the writings of this author.
“It is unequivocally ascertained,” says he, “that
the doctrine of contagion, as the cause of epidemic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>diseases, was unknown to the ancient physicians;
by whom these maladies were expressly attributed
to the air:” and he then proceeds to state that the
prevalent notion of contagion being an inherent quality
of pestilential fever, is derived from a Popish
plot of the sixteenth century; an assertion which has
not even the merit of originality<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c011'><sup>[180]</sup></a>. <i>Hippocrates</i>
and <i>Celsus</i> do not certainly take any notice of the
subject of contagion; but <i>Aristotle</i>, <i>Thucydides</i>, <i>Livy</i>,
<i>Virgil</i>, <i>Lucretius</i>, <i>Ovid</i>, <i>Galen</i>, and <i>Arctæus</i> all contain
passages which prove most unequivocally their
belief in the contagious nature of Epidemics; the
limits of this work will not allow us to be prodigal
in illustrations, we must therefore refer the reader to
a very interesting memoir upon the subject by Dr.
<i>Yeats</i>. (<cite>Journal of Science and the Arts.</cite>) With
respect to the work of Dr. <i>Maclean</i> we would further
observe, that he has artfully brought together all
those facts which are calculated to afford any support
to his doctrine, while he has so ingeniously tortured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>those that make against it, as to disguise their force
and true bearings. Mr. <i>Tully</i><a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c011'><sup>[181]</sup></a> has lately furnished
the public with some striking instances of the total
want of candour with which Dr. <i>Maclean</i> pursued his
researches, but the fact is that he determined on the
Plague being <em>non</em>-contagious long before he ever
visited those countries where it prevails; and hence
all the advantages which he possessed, and the
opportunities of investigation which his residence in
the Levant afforded, have not contributed one fact
to the elucidation of the subject, but have, on the
contrary, thrown additional obstacles in the path of
the honest inquirer.—What can be the organization
of that man’s mind, who goes into the Greek Pest
Hospital at Constantinople, and, according to his
own statement, is attacked on the fifth day after he
entered it, with the Plague, and yet continues to
assert that the malady is <em>non-contagious</em>?</p>

<p class='c000'>To Dr. <i>Maclean</i>, however, the medical world are
certainly greatly indebted, for had not his <cite>Researches</cite>
been published, it is more than probable that the
question of Contagion would not have received the
many able elucidations which the experience and
science of this country has since afforded it:<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c011'><sup>[182]</sup></a> nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>would an opportunity have occurred by which the
most eminent physicians, and those practically acquainted
with the malady, could have delivered a
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</span></i> opinion before a Committee of the House
of Commons.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c011'><sup>[183]</sup></a> It may be thought extraordinary
that a work, so unphilosophical as that to which we
allude, should have created so strong a public sensation;
but when we consider the eagerness with
which mankind seize any circumstance, however
weak, that points towards the removal of burdens
under which they are suffering, we shall cease to
feel surprised that a work of such bold, and promising
assertions, should have soon found its way, through
commercial channels, to the table of the Privy Council;
nor is it strange that government, naturally
anxious to relieve commerce of unnecessary burdens,
should have instituted an inquiry to ascertain whether
Quarantine regulations were actually necessary, and
how far they might be relaxed with safety to the
country. A report was accordingly requested from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>the College of Physicians; who, in order to meet
the wishes of the government, appointed a committee
from their own body to undertake the requisite
examination; it is almost unnecessary to state the
conclusion at which they arrived; their report is virtually
included in that of the Committee of the House
of Commons (for which <i>see Appendix, p. 185</i>.) With
respect to the contagious nature of those fevers which
have lately committed their ravages in these dominions,
especially in Ireland, the proofs appear
to be so satisfactory and evident, that we question
the stability of that man’s mind who can doubt, and
still more who can deny it. But although the question
of contagion as relating to certain epidemics
appears to be firmly established, we are by no means
insensible to the difficulties and anomalies with
which the subject is embarrassed; several of which
are so important in relation to Police legislation, that
we feel it necessary to offer a few observations upon
each of the following questions, and which appear to
include all the leading points of controversy.</p>

<p class='c017'>I. <i>Are all Epidemic Fevers contagious?</i></p>

<p class='c016'>II. <i>Does the matter of Contagion require the aid of
a certain state of the air (Pestilential constitution)
to give effect to its powers, and propagation;
and to what causes is the decline and cessation
of a contagious pestilence to be attributed?</i></p>

<p class='c016'>III. <i>Can filth and animal putrefaction generate
contagion?</i></p>

<p class='c016'>IV. <i>Can a Fever produced by fatigue, unwholesome
food, &amp;c. be rendered contagious in its career
by animal filth, impure air, &amp;c.</i></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>I. <i>Are all Epidemic Fevers contagious?</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It has been maintained by Cleghorn<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c011'><sup>[184]</sup></a>, Hamilton<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c011'><sup>[185]</sup></a>,
Clark<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c011'><sup>[186]</sup></a>, and Fordyce<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c011'><sup>[187]</sup></a>, that <em>all</em> fevers
are naturally contagious; a position which, if less
mischievous in its tendency, is equally erroneous in
principle, as that which rejects the doctrine of contagion
altogether. It is most probable that none of
those fevers which are produced by marsh <i>miasmata</i>
are ever propagated from one individual to another
by contagion; ample evidence of this truth is afforded
by the writings of Dr. James <i>Lind</i><a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c011'><sup>[188]</sup></a>, where it appears
that the most malignant and fatal species of
fever have been contracted on shore, but which had
never been communicated to the ship’s company.
Dr. Trotter<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c011'><sup>[189]</sup></a> also says, “in a voyage down the coast
of Guinea, in the Assistance, in the year 1762, we
had scarcely a man indisposed. We wooded and watered
at the island of St. Thomas, and with a view
to expedition, a tent was erected on shore, in which
the people employed on these services were lodged
during the night. On the middle passage every man
who slept on shore died, and the rest of the ship’s
company remained remarkably healthy.” For similar
facts see <cite>Medical Observations and Inquiries, vol.</cite>
iv, <i>p. 156</i>; <cite>Clarke’s Observations on the Diseases
which prevail in long Voyages to Hot Countries, p.
124</cite>; and <cite>Dr. Robertson’s Meterological and Physical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Observations, &amp;c. 4to, p. 32, 33, and 98</cite>. And in
connection with this subject, it becomes our duty to
offer a few remarks upon the nature of that peculiar
Epidemic, called <span class='sc'>The Yellow Fever</span>.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c011'><sup>[190]</sup></a> Its
doubtful affinity with bilious intermittent and remittent
fevers, has furnished a subject for keen controversy;
and while its contagious quality has been
pertinaciously maintained by one set of Physicians,<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c011'><sup>[191]</sup></a>
it has been as warmly denied by others. The malady
has raged repeatedly as an Epidemic in the United
States, and was considered for some time as <em>Endemic</em>
to that country. “The interests of humanity,” says
Dr. Rush,<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c011'><sup>[192]</sup></a> “are deeply concerned in the admission
of the rare and feeble contagion of the yellow fever,
and Philadelphia must admit the unwelcome truth
sooner or later that the yellow fever is engendered in
her own bowels; or she must renounce her character
for knowledge and policy, and perhaps with it, her
existence, as a commercial city.” In the year 1811,
one of the most acute and learned works<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c011'><sup>[193]</sup></a> that has
graced the literary annals of our country, appeared
from the pen of Dr. <a id='ban'></a><i>Bancroft</i>, in order to prove that
the yellow fever is no other than an aggravated form
of that multifarious disease, which is well known to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>result from the action of those exhalations commonly
denominated <i>marsh miasmata</i>, and that, like all fevers
from that cause, it possesses <em>no contagious</em> quality;
but he adds, “it is indeed probable that the <i>miasmata</i>
of particular towns, mostly either sea-ports, or
accessible to shipping, in which the aggravated forms
of yellow fever have almost exclusively prevailed in
the West Indies, the United States of America, and
the Southern parts of Europe, differ from the common
exhalations of marshes, in <em>quality</em>, as well as
degrees of concentration: but whether this difference
be occasioned merely by the greater heat which, at
such times, commonly exists in these towns than in
the surrounding country, and which may exalt the
powers of such <i>miasmata</i>, by perfecting the decompositions
which produce them, or whether it be partly
the result of a difference in the organized matters decomposed
by that excessive temperature, I am unable
to determine.” We must refer the reader to Dr.
<i>Bancroft’s</i><a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c011'><sup>[194]</sup></a> work for farther information upon the
subject; and we have little doubt but that, after an
attentive consideration of the rich store of facts and
observations which this author has presented to us,
he will be led to a conclusion in favour of the general
non-contagious nature of this malady, although we
by no means intend to deny that it never assumes the
character of a contagious Epidemic. Sir Gilbert
<i>Blane</i>, whose testimony upon this subject must necessarily
have great weight, has made the following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>observations. “In that district of the globe in
which are situated the islands called the Great and
Little Antilles, also in the continental regions round
the gulph of Mexico, and along the coast of South
America, the fevers which prevail there have certain
symptoms peculiar to themselves, and not occurring
in any other part of the globe, except when carried
from thence, which they sometimes have been, particularly
to the sea-port towns of North America, and
the South of Europe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The peculiarities alluded to, consist in a universal
yellowness of the skin, and the vomiting of a dark
coloured fluid, resembling the grounds of coffee.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sir Gilbert <i>Blane</i> considers, that the yellow fever
may proceed from three remote causes, very distinct
in their nature. The <em>First</em>, is that which consists in
the exhalations of the soil, such as produce the endemic
fevers in other countries and climates, and prevailing
chiefly in autumn. The <em>Second</em>, is that which
consists in foul air engendered on board of ships on
long voyages, in circumstances of personal filth, and
want of ventilation, frequently combined with hardships
and privations, and is the same with those stagnated
and corrupted effluvia of the living human
body, which produce typhus fever. The <em>Third</em> cause
is that in which there is no suspicion of foul air,
either from the soil, or from the living human body,
but merely from circumstances of intemperance, fatigue,
and insolation, affecting chiefly, and almost
exclusively, new comers from temperate and cold
climates.<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c011'><sup>[195]</sup></a> The first of these, he says, may be distinguished
by the appellation of the <em>Endemic</em>; the
second, by that of the <em>Pestilential</em>, <em>Malignant</em>, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span><em>Typhus Icterodes</em>; the third, by that of <em>Sporadic</em>.<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c011'><sup>[196]</sup></a>
And Sir Gilbert adds, that it has been for want of
making this distinction, and from classing all these
three under one head, that the endless and acrimonious
controversies regarding contagion have arisen.
There is not the least suspicion in any rational mind,
that the endemic and sporadic species are contagious,
this is only alleged with regard to the pestilential or
typhus species; but it may be asked what proof there
is that this last is specifically different from the other
two? To this Sir Gilbert answers, that it is a matter
of history; that besides the endemic and sporadic
fevers prevailing at all times in the above-mentioned
regions, there has occurred at various intervals of
time, a raging epidemic,<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c011'><sup>[197]</sup></a> which could be traced
to the arrival of a ship or ships in the circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>above recited, and at a season in which the ordinary
malignant fevers do not prevail. To those engaged
in researches upon this obscure subject we would
farther recommend the perusal of a work lately published
by that veteran in the cause, <span class='sc'>Dr. Jackson</span>,
on the subject of the Andalusian Fevers<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c011'><sup>[198]</sup></a>; in
which he examines the evidence in support of the
supposed introduction of the yellow fever into Spain,
and of its real or supposed propagation by contagion.
The importation of the disease from a foreign country
is credited by the authorities and mass of people in
Spain, though the author thinks it has never been
proved by evidence, or even brought to reasonable
probability; the events of the year 1820 stripping
the assumption of every claim to credence, as no attempt
has been made to trace the disease, in that instance,
to foreign origin. The belief universally
obtains through Spain, that the disease is personally
contagious; that is, capable of propagation from individual
to individual, by contact or proximity; Dr.
Jackson, however, considers that this opinion, confidently
as it is maintained, is invalidated by authentic
facts and records; but we must proceed to the
consideration of our second problem, viz:</p>

<h3 class='c010'>II. <i>Does the matter of Contagion require the aid of a certain state of the air, (“Pestilential Constitution of the atmosphere.”) to give effect to its powers, and propagation; and to what causes are the decline and cessation of a contagious Pestilence to be attributed?</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>It was laid down as a fundamental principle by Dr.
<i>Mead</i>, that a “<em>corrupt</em>” state of the air is indispensable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>to the diffusion of a plague; and although we
are at this day unable to ascertain in what this vitiated
state of the air consists, yet there are too many
stubborn facts on record to allow us to deny, or even
to doubt the necessity of its existence for the propagation
of a contagious fever. How are we otherwise
to explain the fact of a malady like the plague, which,
although it shall never be entirely absent from a city,
rages only epidemically and fatally at particular
times? Thus it is collected from the bills of mortality
of London, that, although there were but four
great plagues in this metropolis during the seventeenth
century, <i>viz.</i> the years 1603, 1625, 1636, and
1665, (in the two first of which about 35,000, and in
the last 68,000 died) yet that there were but three
years, from the commencement of the bills of mortality
in 1603 until 1670, which were entirely free from
the plague.<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c011'><sup>[199]</sup></a> <i>Diemerbroeck</i> also remarks, that
whenever the plague has been excited out of its proper
season it has not spread; a fact corroborated by
<i>Russel</i> and <i>Hodges</i>.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c011'><sup>[200]</sup></a> It seems probable that a
particular state of the atmosphere, in its relation to
temperature and humidity, is one of the conditions,
subordinate perhaps, of this “pestilential constitution.”
Dr. <i>Russel</i> has observed that, in <em>winter</em>,
when infected persons have come to places about
Aleppo, some of whom have died of the disease in the
families where they lodged, the distemper was not by
such means propagated. Dr. <i>Pugnet</i> says that the
susceptibility of a person for the contagion of plague
is greatly increased by a moderately warm and moist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>atmosphere; and Dr. <i>Bancroft</i><a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c011'><sup>[201]</sup></a> has adduced some
observations made by himself in proof of the influence
of atmospheric heat and cold, in both their
extremes, in rendering the contagion dormant. The
singular career which a pestilential epidemic runs,
having a beginning, height, and decline, can only be
explained on the idea of the pestilential constitution
of the air undergoing corresponding changes; and it
is probable that the return of a plague is a revival of
infection that has been latent, or dormant, until a
particular state of atmosphere rouses it to action.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>III. <i>Can Filth and Animal Putrefaction generate Contagion?</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>We have already made an allusion to some of those
facts that must assist us in the solution of this problem,
under the head of Public Health (<i>see page <a href='#Page_98'>98</a></i>.)
“The putrefaction of animal matter,” says Dr. <i>Bancroft</i>,<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c011'><sup>[202]</sup></a>
“is but a natural separation of organized
bodies, previously held together by animal or vegetable
life, by which there can be no chance, nor even
possibility of thus generating any thing so wonderful,
and so immutable as contagion; which resembling
animals and vegetables in the faculty of propagating
itself, must, like them, have been the original work
of our common creator, and must have been continued
in existence by the energies of a living principle,
exerted successively in the different bodies,
through which it has been transmitted from one generation
to another; as well might we revive the forever
exploded doctrine of equivocal generation, and
believe, as formerly, that insects and reptiles are the
offsprings of mere corruption, as to believe that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>substance so <a id='anal'></a>analogous to them, in that most mysterious
and essential function of self-propagation, could
originate from that cause, or from any operation of
chemical agencies alone.” We are not disposed to
believe that the specific contagion of typhus can thus
be directly generated, but may not typhus be excited
by causes independent of contagion, and having been
once generated become contagious? If, says Dr.
<i>O’Brien</i>, the opinion that contagion is the <em>only</em> source
of typhus be true, we are at once reduced to the necessity
of supposing that all contagious diseases were
derived from Adam himself. It is an indubitable
fact that the plague has always first appeared, and
established its head quarters, in the filthiest parts of
crowded, ill constructed, and large cities. <i>Blackmore</i>
remarks that the impurity and filth, connected
with the galleys and slaves at Marseilles, filled the
air with offensive smells easily perceivable by those
who passed along the adjoining shore; and in 1720
the plague broke out there; in London, Dr. <i>Heberden</i>
also observes, that the plagues of 1626 and 1636
broke out at Whitechapel, a part of the town which
abounded with poor, and with slaughter-houses.
The importance of cleanliness is also shewn by the
exemption of Oxford<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c011'><sup>[203]</sup></a> and other places from pestilential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>diseases, as recorded by different authorities,
in consequence of regulations for ensuring it; while
the late dreadful increase of contagious fever in Cork
sufficiently demonstrates the evils which arise from
deficient ventilation and accumulated filth, and to
which causes Dr. <i>Barry</i>, in his report, ascribes the
awful afflictions to which we allude. <i>Erasmus</i>, in a
letter to <i>Franciscus</i>, Cardinal <i>Wolsey’s</i> physician,
ascribes the sweating sickness, which was a species
of plague, in a great measure to the incommodious
form, and bad exposition of their houses, to
the filthiness of the streets, and to the sluttishness
within doors.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c011'><sup>[204]</sup></a> That particular species of typhus,
which is called from its origin the <i>Jail Fever</i>, is evidently
the offspring of filth and deficient ventilation.
The Lord Chancellor <i>Bacon</i> has made the following
observation upon this subject: “The most pernicious
infection next to the plague is the smell of the jail,
where prisoners have been long, close, and nastily
kept; whereof we have had, in our time, experience
twice or thrice, when both the judges that sat upon
the jail, and numbers of those who attended the business,
or were present, sickened upon it, and died.”<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c011'><sup>[205]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Dr. Bancroft, who has dwelt very fully upon the subject
of jail fever,<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c011'><sup>[206]</sup></a> considers it as a species of typhus,
the contagious essence of which is not generated,
but merely lighted up by the filth of prisons.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>
  <h3 class='c010'>IV. <i>Can a Fever produced by fatigue, unwholsome food, &amp;c. be rendered contagious in its career by animal filth, impure air, &amp;c.?</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>We have no hesitation in answering this question
in the affirmative, and our opinion will receive ample
support from the history of the different epidemic
fevers which have raged in our own times. Dr.
<i>Prichard</i><a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c011'><sup>[207]</sup></a> is persuaded that a contagious fever may
have a spontaneous origin, that is, that the ordinary
sources of derangement may occasion such a kind of
disordered action, that the excretions or effluvia from
the subject of it shall, under certain circumstances,
produce a specific effect upon another. The truth of
this position is amply confirmed by comparing the different
phenomena which, according to Dr. <i>Prichard</i>,<a href='#f207' class='c011'><sup>[207]</sup></a>
are displayed by the epidemic in St. Peter’s Hospital,
and the Bristol Infirmary; in the former house
the medical wards are very small, having been originally
destined, not for the accommodation of the
sick, but for the abode of paupers; in consequence
of which it became necessary to place the beds very
near to each other, and to crowd the rooms with patients;
under these circumstances the disease was
manifestly contagious, while in the well-ventilated
Bristol Infirmary, notwithstanding the indiscriminate
manner in which the patients with fever were scattered
through the wards, not a single instance occurred
of its propagation. The Dublin Reports of
Drs. <i>Grattan</i><a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c011'><sup>[208]</sup></a> and <i>Crampton</i><a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c011'><sup>[209]</sup></a> are equally satisfactory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>upon this question; atmospheric vicissitudes,
intemperance, fatigue, suppressed perspiration, the
depressing passions, &amp;c. when excessive, will induce
fever; and under these circumstances, the accumulation
of animal effluvia, in filthy, crowded, and ill-ventilated
dwellings, will generate contagion, which
of course accelerates the march of the epidemic.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having thus, as briefly as the nature of the subject
would allow, enumerated the several questions to
which the doctrine of contagion has given rise, we
now proceed to the consideration of those legislative
enactments, by which different nations are enabled to
ward off the calamities of Plague. It is generally
admitted, that the plague has not originated in this
country; and therefore, from its insular situation, the
infection can only be introduced through the medium
of ships. Egypt, the Levant, and other parts of the
Mediterranean are seldom free from it, and hence it
is chiefly through the medium of the commerce with
these countries that the importation of the contagion
is to be apprehended. To guard against this danger,
the different governments require all ships sailing
from any of these parts, to bring certificates from the
magistracy of the port they last came from, declaring
their country free from any contagious distemper:
these are called “<span class='sc'>Bills of Health</span>,” and are distinguished
as <em>clean</em> or <em>foul</em>, as the place they come
from may be healthy or infected. On the production
of these bills it is determined by the Guardians of
Health (in England, Custom-house officers) whether
the vessel shall be permitted to trade or communicate,
or, as it is technically expressed, be permitted to
<i>pratique</i> till she has performed a <span class='sc'>Quarantine</span><a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c011'><sup>[210]</sup></a> of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>as many days as the superintendants may in their
judgment or caprice be pleased to direct. A period
of <em>forty</em> days (hence the term <i>Quarantine</i>) has been
generally fixed upon as the maximum of this seclusion,
on the expiration of which it is customary
abroad for physicians, accompanied by some members
of the board of health, who are frequently merchants
of the place, to examine the ship’s crew; and
strict search is made on board, by persons appointed
to see whether the number of sailors and passengers
corresponds with those mentioned in the bills of
health, and if any difference appears it will be difficult
in any country to obtain admission to <i>pratique</i>,
or at least it will be necessary to perform a full quarantine
from the time of such detection.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Such commodities however as are <em>deemed</em> incapable
of retaining or communicating the infectious
taint, as corn, &amp;c. are permitted to be landed immediately
by the mariners themselves, at proper places
provided for that purpose, which are generally called
<span class='sc'>Lazarettos</span>, some of which in the principal ports
of the Mediterranean are of very considerable extent,
and as to division and appropriation appear so well
calculated for their intended purposes as to be worthy
of imitation. The best praise of their regulation is
indeed to be found in their success; for though twelve
months never elapse but that the plague rages in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>some part of the Levant and of the coasts of Barbary,
the infection has seldom reached the coasts of
Italy, France, or Spain. Terrible exceptions may
be adduced to this remark, yet they may generally be
traced to some clandestine violation of the Quarantine
laws, rather than to their imperfect execution, as
in the recent instance of the plague<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c011'><sup>[211]</sup></a> at Malta in
1813, when the cupidity of a poor cobler in smuggling
some materials from a Greek or Turkish vessel
in the harbour of Valetta, introduced the pest into
the island, to which he and his family fell the first
victims.</p>

<p class='c000'>The objections to the Quarantine laws, as executed
in the Mediterranean, arise more from the indiscriminate
and vexatious application of them to cases for
which they were not provided, than from any general
relaxation or want of vigilance in the officers appointed
to enforce them: occasionally indeed the courtesy of
these gentlemen will deem a governor or wealthy noble
to be incapable of communicating infection, though
from the most suspected port, while a whole fleet of
merchantmen, arriving with clean bills from the
Atlantic, will be detained for some weeks, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex abundanti
cautela</span></i>, without admission to <i>pratique</i>; from such
instances travellers who have been annoyed, and
merchants who have been injured, have imbibed a
very general prejudice against these laws; nor have
they wanted learned authorities to contend with
them for their abolition, on the grounds of their abstract
inutility in preventing infection (admitting the
contagious nature of the disease which some have denied),
and the injurious tendency to the general interests
of commerce.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>We have drawn the readers attention to the regulations
of the Mediterranean, because we are convinced
that if there be any value in the system it
must be made complete in all its parts, and ought to
be as much the subject of international as of local
legislation; unless all countries, and more particularly
those in more immediate contact or communication
with the infected regions, concur in the restrictions,
it will be vain to enforce them in Great Britain.
In the instance of the plague, the want of precaution
among the Mahomedans allows the disorder to spread
from Constantinople to every part of Greece, from
<a id='smy'></a>Smyrna to the whole African coast of the Mediterranean,
while the European shores are free from its
calamitous progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the statute 26 <i>Geo.</i> 2, all vessels, persons, and
goods, coming from places from whence the plague
may be brought, were subject to perform Quarantine
in such places as shall be appointed by his Majesty in
Council,<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c011'><sup>[212]</sup></a> and notified by proclamation in the London
Gazette; this and all other acts relating to Quarantine
were repealed by the 45th <i>Geo.</i> 3, <i>c.</i> 10, by
which these laws were more extensively regulated,
certain duties are levied for the maintenance of the
system, and until they are paid according to the tonnage
(see 26 <i>Geo.</i> 3, <i>c.</i> 60) of the vessel, she cannot be
permitted to clear inwards; it is enacted that all
ships and vessels, as well his Majesty’s ships of war
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>as all others, coming from or having touched at any
place, from whence his Majesty in Council shall have
adjudged and declared it probable that the plague or
any other infectious disease highly dangerous to the
health of his Majesty’s subjects, may be brought; and
all ships, vessels, or boats, which may have received
any person, goods, letters, &amp;c. from such vessels,
&amp;c. shall be considered liable to Quarantine within
the meaning of the Act, and to any order of the King
in Council, published by Proclamation in the London
Gazette. “And whereas certain goods and merchandize
are more especially liable to retain infection,
and may be brought from places infected into other
countries, and from thence imported into Great
Britain or the islands aforesaid,” his Majesty is
enabled to make special orders as to any particular
goods or vessels liable to any alarming or suspicious
circumstances. In cases of emergency, the privy
council, or any three of them, may make such orders
as they shall think necessary; and this not only as to
ships and merchandize, but generally in case of infectious
disease appearing in Great Britain. This clause
deserves very particular attention, for though we
have been happily free from any very severe visitation
of contagious disease, yet there are instances
where local regulations would have been highly expedient,
at least to the extent of directing the destruction
of the clothes and beddings of persons dying of
highly infectious disorders, and securing the purification,
fumigation, and ventilation of their rooms or
houses; some doubt may indeed arise whether the
words of the clause are sufficiently strong to warrant
such measures, “and in case of any infectious disease
or distemper appearing or breaking out in Great
Britain or the islands aforesaid, to make such orders,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>and give such directions, in order to cut off
all communication between any persons infected
with any such disease or distemper and the rest of
his Majesty’s subjects, as shall appear to the said
Lords of his Majesty’s privy council, or any three
or more of them, to be necessary or expedient;”

<p class='c000'>In Ireland the system of quarantine is regulated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>by the 40th Geo. 3. c. 79, the general outline of
which is the same as in the English acts, but with
some additional severity towards health officers
neglecting their duty, the infliction of which may
occasionally be necessary.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c011'><sup>[215]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It now only remains for us to offer a few remarks
upon the practical question to which all our preceeding
researches have naturally tended: Whether the
regulations of Quarantine might not be relaxed and
modified without increasing the hazard of infection?
Before this subject can be seriously entertained, or
any concessions safely granted in favour of the mercantile
interests, it must be upon the perfect understanding,
and unreserved admission, that the maladies
against which they are directed, are in the most
extensive signification of the term, <span class='sc'>Contagious</span>.
No claim to indulgence or exemption can be admitted,
on the ground of professional scepticism, as it relates
to the subject of infection, for notwithstanding the
remarks of Dr. <i>Adams</i>,<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c011'><sup>[216]</sup></a> and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">male sedula nutrix</span></i>
of Ovid, of which he so sarcastically reminds us, we
are still unphilosophical enough to maintain that
“<em>one cannot be too cautious</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>To those who consider our long immunity from
plague a sufficient guarantee for our future security,
it may be observed, that although the Island of Malta
is, from many causes, much more exposed to this infection
than Great Britain, yet it was free from plague
for <em>one hundred and thirty-eight</em> years, a period which
we must remember has been exceeded in our own
case by only sixteen years; at the same time we are
ready to admit with a periodical writer, that Quarantine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>regulations might be amended, and rendered less
inconvenient to commerce; they might for instance
be modified as to the required period of segregation.
Dr. <i>Harrison</i>, in his examination before the select
committee of the house, stated a fact in connection
with this subject, that deserves particular notice:
that while passengers, who have made a long voyage,
are liable to perform quarantine, couriers, who come
in the least possible time, are not under such restrictions.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>MEDICAL POLICE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>With the exception of the Quarantine laws, which
on account of their superior importance have been
treated in a separate chapter, and some incidental,
rather than direct, aids which the subject receives
from the law of nuisances, &amp;c. there is but little of
that regulation in England which can be strictly denominated
<span class='sc'>Medical Police</span>.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c011'><sup>[217]</sup></a> We have already
expressed our opinion upon the apparent inattention
of our Government to this branch of legislation, and
have considered it as the necessary consequence of
the cleanliness and good order by which this nation
is so pre-eminently distinguished; there are, however,
some very material points, the value of which is
acknowledged by local adoption, while no good reason
has been adduced against their general extension;
these are the examination of drugs and medicines by
the Censors of the College of Physicians; the Irish
Health Act; and the weekly Bills of Mortality.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been remarked from the Bench, that there
might be particular reasons for taking especial care of
the health of the Capital; granting this to be true, it
still appears extraordinary that no measures of precaution
should have been adopted to prevent or restrain
the sale of factitious, impure, spoilt, or deleterious
drugs or medicines, in any part of England,
excepting only the city of London; while it is evident
that from various causes, such as greater and more
rapid sale, general competition, superiority of purchasers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>and facility of detection, frauds or negligences
are less likely to happen in the metropolis
than in the provinces; where the slowness and uncertainty
of demand may in some degree excuse the purchase
of originally inferior articles from the wholesale
dealers, and will generally account for the subsequent
deterioration of the best drugs. It would occupy
too much of our reader’s time and attention, and very
possibly be considered as irrelevant to the object of
the present work, if we were to enter into any details
upon this occasion, and to enumerate the different
medicinal substances which, although originally genuine,
become in a short space of time worse than
useless, or whose properties by the operation of local
causes are changed or destroyed.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c011'><sup>[218]</sup></a> This is a loss
upon which the country practitioner must calculate;
but that the inconvenience and danger may not fall
upon his patients, it is surely expedient that some authority
should be established to examine and destroy,
as in London, all spoilt or deteriorated medicines;
for this purpose, provincial censors might be nominated
by the College of Physicians, either from
among their own members, or from the most eminent
Licenciates, whose duty it would be to make frequent
visits for the purpose of examination, in market
towns; and in all other places, whenever they were
called upon by any sufficient occasion, or requisition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another equally important restriction is requisite
as well in London as in the provinces, against the sale
of poisonous, or highly dangerous drugs, to unknown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>persons. A week scarcely elapses without the relation
in the public journals, of some awful case of
murder, suicide, or fatal accident; surely this is sufficient
to shew the necessity of some new enactment
on the subject. We are willing to admit that it would
be difficult to frame an act which should comprehend
and class all the several articles that negligence,
folly, or malice might pervert to the destruction of
human life: the desired effect would, however be
best attained by giving to some competent authority
the power of publishing and enforcing, from time to
time, such regulations and restrictions as might be
found practically necessary. <em>Arsenic</em>, for example,
is of all others, the poison most easy to procure, under
various pretences; while from its exceeding virulence,
insipidity, and other qualities, it is most fatally
adapted to the horrible purposes of murder. The general
pretext for its purchase is that of the intended
destruction of vermin; now if mixed with one hundred
times its weight of tallow it would be equally, if
not better adapted to the avowed object, while at the
same time it would be thus rendered an inapplicable
instrument for the perpetration of crime. On other
occasions it might be combined with some highly nauseous
and colouring material; but it ought never to
be sold in a pure form, except to persons who are
well known, and whose ordinary trades and occupations
justify their application for a supply. <em>Laudanum</em>,
or <em>Opium</em>, from its nauseous taste and smell,
is seldom applied to the purpose of murder, except
by suicides; against the sale of these drugs it would
be most difficult to guard, although many fatal results
might have been averted by vigilance and judicious
precaution; the Chemist or Apothecary cannot with
propriety refuse it, but he is not bound to supply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>more than a single dose to a stranger, and that should
be mixed with some appropriate vehicle, in order to
prevent the designing applicant collecting from shop
to shop a quantity sufficient for any criminal purpose.
And we are of opinion that the master, or principal
assistant, should be alone allowed to dispense dangerous
medicines. The careless substitution of one
drug for another must be also considered as a prolific
source of mischief; this frequently happens in the
shop of the chemist or druggist, where it is least excusable;
at other times it occurs from the negligence
of some individual, who leaves a <a id='poison'></a>poisonous substance
in company with articles that are intended for ordinary
use. <em>Oxalic acid</em>, to which so many deaths have
been lately attributed, may serve as an instance; in
its external characters it bears such a resemblance to
those of common <em>Epsom salts</em>, as readily to deceive
the ordinary observer; and as both substances very frequently
become articles of retail custom, they are
usually kept ready for sale, in parcels of an ounce
each, a practice which renders a careless substitution
an error of common occurrence; the employment
of a particularly coloured paper, that of <em>yellow</em>
for instance, if used universally as a wrapper for poisonous
articles, upon which also the word <em>poison</em>, or
<em>dangerous</em>, might be legibly printed, would to a certain
degree guarantee the safety of the purchaser; but
as danger might notwithstanding be apprehended in
the night, a paper of a distinct texture might afford
additional security; the peculiar roughness of the
Dutch filtering paper which is manufactured from
woollen would answer such a purpose. The labels
of phials should in this particular correspond with the
wrappers of dry substances; if the distinction were
once generally adopted by the various dealers, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>would soon become notorious to indifferent individuals,
and many fatal accidents might be prevented,
without the aid of legislative enactment.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c011'><sup>[219]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The College of Physicians, or a mixed Committee
of the Medical Bodies, might be best entrusted with
the powers of regulation to which we have alluded;
while to obviate the jealousy to which such an extension
of their authority would be likely to give rise, a
clause might be introduced, that no regulation should
be binding, until sanctioned by a certain number of the
judges, as is done in some other cases of inferior jurisdictions.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be also expedient to establish some summary
jurisdiction by which fumigation, whitewashing,
and other cleansing operations, and the burning of
infected clothes, might be effected without delay,
whenever the prevalence of a contagious disease required
it. The Irish Health Act (59 <i>Geo.</i> 3. <i>c.</i> 41,
<i>see</i> <span class='sc'>Appendix</span>, <i>p.</i> 164) might also be extended to
such places in England as by authority should be,
from time to time, declared infected.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>BILLS OF MORTALITY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Bills of Mortality were instituted in the city of
London in the year 1592, in order to collect and exhibit
the number of deaths, and to record the progress,
diffusion, and decline of the epidemic malady,
with which the city was at that time infested; but
upon the cessation of the plague, the bills were discontinued.
It appears, however, in consequence of
the recurrence of the sickness, that they were reestablished
by public order in 1603, and on the 29th
of October in the same year, being the first of the
reign of King James, the establishment of a regular
series of weekly bills of death commenced. In 1606
the number of christenings, as well as that of burials,
appeared in the returns, and although diseases and
casualties were recorded as early as 1604, no public
notice was made of either before the year 1629, when
another important improvement took place—that of
distinguishing between the sexes. In 1728 the ages<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c011'><sup>[220]</sup></a>
of all who died from under two years of age and upwards
were regularly specified, and this may be considered
as the last<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c011'><sup>[221]</sup></a> improvement which the bills of
mortality have received; for notwithstanding the rapid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>march of those arts and sciences with which every
branch of statistics is so intimately connected, the
contents, arrangement, and language of these bills
have remained unchanged. The collating, printing,
and publishing these documents, as far as they relate
to the metropolis, are placed under the superintendance
and jurisdiction of the ancient corporation of
parish clerks:<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c011'><sup>[222]</sup></a> a power which it is hardly necessary
to observe is wholly inadequate to the accomplishment
of the medical, political, and moral objects
which these bills are calculated to promote.
As to the nature of the diseases of which persons die,
much error must necessarily arise from the absurd
manner in which the investigation is conducted, as
the following statement will clearly demonstrate.—The
churchwardens of each parish within the bills of
mortality, appoint two old women to the office of
<i>Searchers</i>, who, on hearing the knell for the dead,
repair to the sexton of the parish, to learn the name
and residence of the deceased. They demand admittance
into the house to examine the body, in order
that they may see that there is nothing suspicious
about it, and <em>judge</em> of what disease the person died,
which they report to the parish clerk. The regular
charge for the performance of this office is <em>fourpence</em>
to each <em>searcher</em>; but if an extra gratuity be tendered,
they seldom trouble the domestics with any examination.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>We entirely agree with Dr. <i>Burrows</i><a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c011'><sup>[223]</sup></a> in
thinking that the office, as at present filled, should
be entirely suppressed; and the attestation of a properly
qualified medical practitioner, upon actual
knowledge of the disease of which the person died, or
upon inquiry and examination of the body, should be
substituted. Were competent persons only appointed
to report, the nomenclature<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c011'><sup>[224]</sup></a> and classification of
diseases, in which there has been little variation
since the origin of the bills, would consequently be
reformed; and we should then derive from them the
elucidation of many important and dubious medical
points, as 1. <i>The causes of many diseases, and their
affinity to one another.</i> 2. <i>The rise, situation, increase,
decrease, and cessation of epidemic and contagious
diseases.</i> 3. <i>The means of guarding against
their extension and effects.</i> 4. <i>The comparative healthiness
of different countries and places, climates, and
seasons.</i> 5. <i>The influence of particular trades and manufactures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>on the human constitution.</i> Such are the
medical advantages which would arise from correct
and enlarged bills of mortality. Dr. William <i>Heberden</i><a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c011'><sup>[225]</sup></a>
has made the following observations upon
this subject: “People have fallen into two opposite
errors concerning the Bills of Mortality; some have
considered their authority as too vague to be made
the foundation of any certain conclusions; and others
have built upon this foundation, without sufficiently
considering its real defects. Both parties are equally
wrong. The agreement of the bills with each other
does alone carry with it a strong proof that the numbers
under the several articles are by no means set down
at random, but must be taken from the uniform operation
of some permanent cause. While the gradual
changes they exhibit in particular diseases, correspond
to the alterations which in time are known to
take place in the channels through which the great
stream of mortality is constantly flowing. That
there are, however, many and very great imperfections
in these bills cannot be doubted; for, <i>First</i>, the
births include only those who are baptized according
to the rites of the church of England, by which means
all Jews, Quakers, and the very numerous body of
dissenters are omitted. <i>Secondly</i>, of those who are
of the church of England, a very large proportion
are either buried in the country, or in burial grounds
adjacent to London, but without the bills; the burials
also in St. Paul’s Cathedral, in Westminster Abbey,
the Temple, the Rolls, Lincoln’s Inn, St. Peters in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>the Tower, the Charter-house, the several hospitals
of the metropolis, and other places which are not parochial
cemeteries, are for that reason omitted; besides
which, the great parishes of Mary-le-bone, and
Pancras, have never yet had a place in the bills of
mortality. <i>Thirdly</i>, many abortives and still-born
are noticed in the deaths, but not in the births.”
Dr. <i>Heberden</i> proceeds to examine the fluctuation
observable in certain diseases, and which he considers
under two distinct points of view; the first comprehending
their variations in different years; the second
those which take place in different parts of the same
year; we must refer the reader for much curious matter,
and useful information, to his work above cited.
Many of the provincial bills of mortality are more
perfect than those of London, a superiority for which
we are indebted to the eminent physicians who have
resided in those districts, in example of which we
have only to refer to those of Chester by Dr. <i>Haygarth</i>,<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c011'><sup>[226]</sup></a>
of York by Dr. <i>White</i>,<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c011'><sup>[227]</sup></a> while from the
returns of Northampton Dr. <i>Price</i> computed his celebrated
tables of the probabilities of life, and in a
curious memoir read before the Royal Society he advances
strong reasons for believing that there is a prodigious
preponderancy in favour of the country above
the most healthy cities.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c011'><sup>[228]</sup></a> We shall conclude this
subject with observing, that the metropolitan bills
establish beyond all doubt the gratifying fact of the
superior healthiness of London, notwithstanding its
increase of population, in the present day to what it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>was during the seventeenth century, when the deaths
exceeded the births, by more than one half of the
whole number; while in the present age, the sum
total of births exceeds that of deaths; the same improvements
have taken place also in the provinces, and
we are borne out by the concurrent testimony of our
best political arithmeticians, in the assertion that the
value of human life is increasing in Great Britain,
while the diminution in the number of certain diseases,
and the total extinction of others, offer the
surest proofs of the general amelioration that has
taken place in our national habits and manners.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Having</span> thus considered, as far as the limits of
our work will allow, the Charters, Statutes, Laws
and Privileges which regulate the several Public and
Corporate Bodies instituted for securing the more
regular practice of Medicine<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c011'><sup>[229]</sup></a> in all its branches:
and having commented also on the Rights, Immunities,
and Liabilities, to which Medical Practitioners
are entitled, or subjected, in their several individual
capacities, and enumerated the prominent subjects relating
to public health, it now remains for us to enter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>into the discussion of the most important branch of our
subject; the most important because, though questions
affecting corporate or individual privileges may be
and occasionally are of great interest to the public,
yet the general administration of justice, as affecting
all classes of men in the enjoyment of their natural
and acquired rights, stands on higher ground, and
demands the best attention of all those who either as
principals or assistants; who as judges, advocates,
<a id='wit'></a>witnesses, or even spectators, are concerned in its due
execution. For this reason, we are about to draw the
attention of Medical <a id='prac2'></a>practitioners to the nature and
importance of the evidence, which they may be required
to give in Courts of Law, on various subjects
in which their science is not merely ancillary, but in
the highest degree essential to the ends of justice.
Nor are these subjects limited, as might at a first and
superficial view appear, to the testimony required of
physicians and surgeons in criminal cases, but extends
in a greater or less degree through every branch
of jurisprudence; nor can we yet assert that we have
anticipated every point on which medical, chemical,
and surgical questions may arise; as recent examples
have evinced, that the rapid progress of science which
has marked the last half century above all others, is
daily eliciting new points both for scientific and judicial
enquiry. We must therefore for the present
content ourselves with following that arrangement of
our subject which is afforded by a natural and immutable
scale,—the life and propagation of the human
species, from its commencement to its close:—prefacing
the subject with some short remarks on the
nature of evidence; not indeed as a legal guide to
the medical witness, but to point out to him the
sources of higher and more general information.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>OF MEDICAL EVIDENCE GENERALLY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As Physicians, Surgeons, and others conversant in
medicine and chemistry, are constantly called upon
to give testimony in Courts of Justice, it is necessary
for us to enter upon this subject of the law of evidence,
so far as it immediately affects the medical
witness; it is proper that he should understand when
he is bound to appear, and on what terms, and it
may be useful for him to be prepared, by some previous
knowledge of the usual course of examination,
for the difficulties and objections which may arise in
the progress of it. A scientific witness, fully acquainted
with the subject in dispute, and by his particular
knowledge well qualified to inform the Court
on the most important points, is too frequently rendered
miserable in himself, and absolutely ineffective
to the ends of justice, by the diffidence which a man
of real acquirement generally feels, when impressed
at once with the novelty of his situation, a sense of
the importance of the duty which he is about to perform,
and a consciousness that the truths which he
is about to utter, may be obscured, suppressed, or perverted,
by technicalities for which he is unprepared
with any defence; we do not mean to arraign the
present forms of examination in general, when we
assert that some abuse in practice too frequently
places the witness in as painful a situation, as if he
were himself a criminal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some knowledge of the law of evidence is the best
security against this inconvenience; we propose therefore
to lay down a few general rules on the points
most likely to occur, and to refer our readers for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>more particular information to those works which
expressly or incidentally treat on this subject.<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c011'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is necessary in the first place to consider how the
attendance of witnesses is to be compelled by process,
under what terms they must appear, their liabilities
if they fail to appear, and their duties when
in Court.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writ of Subpœna <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad testificandum</span></i>, is the ordinary
process of the Courts for compelling the attendance
of witnesses; by this the intended witness is
required to appear at the trial at a fixed time and
place, to testify what he knows in the cause, under the
penalty of £100 to be forfeited to the king.</p>

<p class='c000'>Four witnesses may be included in one subpœna,
but a ticket containing the substance of the writ
(which is to be shewn at the same time) is as effectual
service as the writ itself, (5 <i>Mod.</i> 355). The
service must be upon the witness in person, (<i>Cro.
Eliz.</i> 130) and within reasonable time, before the
trial, respect being always had to the residence and
circumstances of the party.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Civil suits, the reasonable expense of the witness
in going to, staying at, and returning from the
place of trial, must be tendered at the time of serving
the subpœna: (5 <i>Eliz.</i> c. 10, f. 12): if this is not
done, the Court will not grant an attachment against
the witness (<i>Fuller v. Prentice</i>, 1 <i>H Bl. Rep</i>. 49)
not even if he be present in Court, and refuse to be
sworn; (<i>Bowles v. Johnson</i>, 1 <i>Bl. Rep.</i> 36). But
where a witness lives within the weekly Bills of
Mortality, it is usual to leave only one shilling with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the subpœna: this limitation is not created by the
statute of <i>Elizabeth</i>, nor have we been able to trace
its origin.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Judge will not compel a witness to be sworn
till his reasonable expenses are paid him. (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi supra.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c000'>If a witness fail to attend on subpœna, without
sufficient excuse, he is liable to be proceeded against
in one of three ways. 1. By attachment for a contempt
of the process of the Court, from which even
a Peer is not exempt. 2. By a special action on the
case for damages at common law. 3. By an action on
the Statute of <i>Elizabeth</i> for the penalty of ten pounds
(5 <i>Mod.</i> 355), and for the further recompense recoverable
under the Statute; but this must be by the party
<em>aggrieved</em>, and where the further damage has been assessed
by the Court, out of which the process issued.
Formerly no remuneration was given to witnesses
attending the trial of criminal causes, yet they were
bound to appear unconditionally, for “Criminal prosecutions
are of public concern, and a witness summoned
to appear on a criminal trial has a public
duty to perform; and he ought not to be at liberty
to make a bargain for his appearance, as he may in
the case of a civil suit, where only private interests
are involved.” (<i>Phill. on Evid.</i>). But as such attendance
must frequently have been productive of considerable
hardship, especially to poor persons, the Statute
22 <i>Geo.</i> 2. <i>c.</i> 3. <i>s.</i> 3. enacts, that when any poor
person shall appear on recognizance to give evidence
in cases of larceny or felony, the Court may order the
Treasurer of the County to pay such person, such sum
as to the Court may seem reasonable: as this Statute
extended only to poor persons who appeared on recognizance,
and not to such as appeared on subpœna,
it was afterwards deemed reasonable by the Legislature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>that every person so appearing on recognizance,
or subpœna, should be allowed his reasonable expenses,
and also in case of poverty, a satisfaction for his
trouble and loss of time. (<i>Phill. on Evid.</i>). The
Statute 18 <i>Geo.</i> 3. <i>c.</i> 19. <i>s.</i> 8. therefore enacts, that
“Where any person shall appear on recognizance or
subpœna to give evidence as to any grand or petit
larceny or other felony, whether any bill or indictment
be preferred or not to the Grand Jury, it shall
be in the power of the Court (provided the person
shall, in the opinion of the Court, have <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i>
attended in obedience to such recognizance or subpœna,)
to order the Treasurer of the County or
Division, in which the offence shall have been committed,
to pay him such sum as to the Court shall
seem reasonable, not exceeding the expenses, which
it shall appear to the Court the said person was
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ fide</span></i> put unto by reason of the said recognizance
and subpœna, making a reasonable allowance,
in case he shall appear to be in poor circumstances,
for trouble and loss of time.” These Statutes
apply only to cases of felony; on prosecutions
therefore for misdemeanors, and in other cases not
specially provided for by Act of Parliament, the Court
is not authorized to order a compensation to witnesses
for their attendance; (7 <i>T. R.</i> 377: see also <cite>Burn’s
Justice</cite>, <cite>tit. County Rate</cite>). As these Acts, and the
45th <i>Geo.</i> 3. <i>c.</i> 92. which compels the attendance of
witnesses in any part of the United Kingdoms, their
expenses being first tendered, do not meet many possible
and probable cases of extreme hardship, it is to
be wished that some further enactments may be made
on this subject: it has indeed been doubted whether
the obligation on witnesses in criminal causes is as
peremptory as we have stated, (1 <cite>Chitty on Criminal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Law</cite>, p. 612), but the weight of authority appears to
be on the other side. Mr. Serjeant <i>Hawkins</i>, 2 P. C.
p. 620, observes that “to persons of opulence and
public spirit this obligation cannot be either hard
or injurious; but indigent witnesses grow weary of
attendance, and frequently bore their own charges
to their great hindrance and loss;” and Sir <i>Mathew
Hale</i> (2 P. C. 282) complains of the want of power in
Judges to allow witnesses their charges, as a great
defect in this part of judicial administration.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our present object is to show that whatever hardship
may exist in this point in general, it presses with
peculiar severity on medical practitioners,<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c011'><sup>[231]</sup></a> to whom
time is most valuable, and the nature of whose profession
requires that they should be continually within
reasonable distance of their ordinary place of residence;
to them therefore the tender of mere traveling
expenses becomes a very insufficient compensation:
the same policy which exempts them from attendance
on other public duties may suggest the propriety
of allowing them some adequate indemnity
when their assistance becomes indispensable, and this
not only for their private and immediate advantage,
but ultimately for the public benefit; for if properly
remunerated for their attendance, practitioners of a
superior class would not be unwilling to devote some
portion of their time to the assistance of public justice;
whereas under the existing system it is notorious,
that all who can, will avoid the burthen; and
the duty therefore devolves on those who are least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>competent to its execution: this evil is particularly
apparent on Coroner’s Inquests, where the opinion of
a shop-boy has often been allowed to determine a
question <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in limine</span></i>, which properly investigated, might
have required the first science to obtain a satisfactory
result.</p>

<p class='c000'>As attendance is more burthensome on a professional
man than on others, so also it is more frequently called
for; men in general can only be summoned as witnesses
when they have, or are reasonably supposed
to have, cognisance of the particular facts in question;
and he may therefore deem himself peculiarly
unfortunate or imprudent, who is often present at such
scenes as give rise to criminal investigation; but the
medical practitioner, in addition to his liability of
being called in for his assistance, and so becoming acquainted
with facts, may also be summoned on matters
of opinion; those therefore who stand highest in
public estimation as men of science and research, will
be most frequently burthened with the execution of
painful and unprofitable duties; we do not believe
that they will shrink from the performance of them
when necessary, but we may express a hope that they
may be rendered as little burthensome as their nature
will allow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Great difficulties must always arise in the examination
of a medical or chemical witness, where the examining
party is uninformed or at least very partially
acquainted with the science in question; for it is next
to impossible for Counsel so to frame their examination
of a scientific witness, as to elicit the whole truth
unless they are, by previously acquired knowledge,
acquainted with the bearings of each answer upon the
case which they are maintaining; and though there
are a few instances of persons of such superior talent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>that they can collect from the mere information of
their briefs, so much knowledge as will enable them
to perform this duty, with credit to themselves and
satisfaction to their clients and the public; yet such
instances are rare, and even those most gifted will
admit that there is a most material difference between
examining a witness on matters of fact of which all
persons who have applied themselves to the laws and
nature of evidence may be competent judges, and the
examination of abstract opinions, and speculations of
philosophy or physics, where the examiner can as
little follow the reasoning of a witness as if he spoke
some foreign and unknown language. For it is impossible
within the compass of any ordinary <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</span></i>
examination to elicit all the points on which explanation
may be necessary, or to remove all the doubts
which may give occasion to future controversy; hence
questions of this kind are seldom determined at the
first hearing, but are repeatedly brought before the
Courts in the form of new trials; the cases of <i>Severn,
King &amp; Co.</i> against several Fire Insurances Offices,
which in part suggested the undertaking of the present
work, may serve as an elucidation of this point. The
causes were conducted by professional men of the first
eminence, the Judge who presided well known for his
love of science, and from having attained more knowledge
in several branches of natural philosophy, than
can usually be acquired by those whose time is engrossed
by severer studies; the witnesses were among
the best Chemists of the day, yet the question (simple
as it might at first appear) whether oil or sugar at
certain temperatures, and under certain circumstances,
should be considered the more inflammable substance,
occupied three days on the first and six days on
the second trial. Notwithstanding which, a third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>trial took place involving the same question, and controversial
pamphlets were published on both sides on
the nature and supposed contradictions of the evidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been supposed that medical practitioners
may avail themselves of the privilege enjoyed by legal
advisers,<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c011'><sup>[232]</sup></a> and that they are not bound to divulge
the secrets of their patients, reposed in them in the
course of professional confidence;<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c011'><sup>[233]</sup></a> undoubtedly this
confidence ought not to be violated on any ordinary
occasion, but when the ends of justice absolutely require
the disclosure, there is no doubt that the medical
witness is not only bound, but compellable to
give evidence; ever bearing in mind that the examination
should not be carried further than may be
relevant to the point in question; of this the Court
will judge, and protect the witness accordingly. In
the celebrated trial of the Duchess of <i>Kingston</i>, before
the House of Peers, (11 <i>Harg.</i> St. Tri. 243) this
point of medical liability was raised by Mr. <i>Cæsar
Hawkins</i>, and determined by Lord <i>Mansfield</i> in the
following words: “I suppose Mr. <i>Hawkins</i> means
to demur to the question upon the ground, that it
came to his knowledge some way from his being
employed as a surgeon for one or both parties;
and I take for granted, if Mr. <i>Hawkins</i> understands
that it is your Lordships opinion that he has no
privilege on that account to excuse himself from
giving the answer, that then, under the authority
of your Lordships judgment, he will submit to
answer it: therefore to save your Lordships the
trouble of an adjournment, if no Lord differs in
opinion, but thinks that a Surgeon has no privilege
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>to avoid giving evidence in a Court of Justice, but
bound by the law of the land to do it; if any of
your Lordships think he has such a privilege it will
be a matter to be debated elsewhere, but if all
your Lordships acquiesce, Mr. <i>Hawkins</i> will understand
that it is your judgment and opinion, that a
Surgeon has no privilege, where it is a material
question, in a civil or criminal cause, to know whether
parties were married, or whether a child was
born, to say that his introduction to the parties
was in the course of his profession, and in that way
he came to the knowledge of it. I take it for
granted, that if Mr. <i>Hawkins</i> understands that, it
is a satisfaction to him, and a clear justification to
all the world. If a Surgeon was voluntarily to reveal
these secrets, to be sure he would be guilty of
a breach of honour, and of great indiscretion; but,
to give that information in a Court of Justice,
which by the law of the land he is bound to do,
will never be imputed to him as any indiscretion
whatever.” The examination consequently proceeded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The observations of Mr. <i>Haslam</i>, in his work on
<cite>Medical Jurisprudence</cite> as it relates to Insanity, (London
1817) are so pertinent to our present subject that
we shall give them in his own words: “The important
duty which the medical practitioner has to
perform, when he delivers his testimony before a
Court of Justice, should be closely defined, conscientiously
felt, and thoroughly understood,—his
opinion ought to be conveyed in a perspicuous
manner; he should be solemnly impressed that he
speaks upon oath, the most sacred pledge before
God between man and man—and that the life of a
human being depends upon the clearness and truth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>of his deposition: he is not to palm on the Court
the trash of medical hypothesis as the apology for
crime; neither should the lunatic receive his cure
at the gallows by the infirmity of his evidence; but
above all, his opinion should be so thoroughly
understood by himself, so founded by experience
and fortified by reason, that it may resist the blandishments
of eloquence and the subtil underminings
of cross examination. The Physician should not
come into Court merely to give his opinion—he
should be able to explain it, and able to afford the
reasons which influenced his decision—without such
elucidation opinion becomes a bare dictum.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is to be regretted that on many occasions, where
several medical practitioners have deposed, there
has been a direct opposition of opinion:—this
difference has sometimes prevailed respecting insanity,
but more frequently in cases of poison. It
is not intended to account for this contrariety of
evidence; much will depend on the sagacity of the
Counsel to institute the proper enquiries, and still
more will be incumbent on the medical evidence, in
order to explain and establish his testimony.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The lawyer’s object is the interest of his employer,
and for the fulfilment of his duty he is frequently
compelled to resort to a severity of investigation
which perplexes the theories, but more frequently
kindles the irritable feelings of the medical practitioner.
This distrust on the part of the lawyer,
however unpalatable, is fully justified, most witnesses
going into Court with the preconcerted intention
of <em>proving</em> to a certain extent:—and those most
conversant in the history of human testimony, have
been extremely scrupulous of admitting it as uniform
truth until it has been carefully sifted. Guarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>with these precautions, and armed with professional
experience, the medical practitioner may approach
the tribunal of justice with confidence and advantage
to the cause of Truth. However dexterous
he may shew himself in fencing with the advocate,
he should be aware that his evidence ought to
impress the judge and be convincing to the jury.”
Their belief must be “the test by which his scientific
opinion is to be established. That which may be
deemed by the medical evidence clear and unequivocal,
may not hit the sense of the gentlemen of
the long robe, nor carry conviction to the jury.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a natural propensity in human nature,
from which the most honorable minds are not free,
to view all questions through the medium of some
preconceived opinion; in law and politics it is every
day evident, in physic and in science it is too often
apparent. Hence our law has wisely contrived its
modes of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivâ voce</span></i> examination, in which the judge,
the jury, and the counsel, on both sides, are equally
empowered to sift the truth, and thus counteract the
leaning which any witness may be supposed to have
towards the party producing him: a foreign writer
of celebrity objects to this method, and prefers the
mode adopted generally on the continent of requiring
written reports or depositions; we leave our readers
to conclude how liable such documents are, especially
with a people of lively imagination, to become controversial
pamphlets, straining on either side for
victory, and not for truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the mode in which a medical witness should
deliver his evidence, very different advice appears to
have been given by different authorities; while some
impatient of delay, and dreading the arts of examination,
recommend their pupils or readers to open at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>once all the stores of their reasoning and information;
others, fearing the effect which cross-examination
may have on nervous or embarrassed witnesses,
advise that no more shall be disclosed than categorically
meets the question of the counsel; and to this
we incline, with this difference, that, as we should
deem too costive a retention of the truth as blamable
as the flow of garrulity with which we have sometimes
seen a court overwhelmed, we recommend the witness
to steer a middle course, first answering patiently,
distinctly, and tersely, the questions put by the
Counsel on both sides, the Court and the jury; and
if none of these elicit the whole truth, and any
material point remains to be disclosed, the presiding
judge will always admit and gratefully receive the
additions or explanations which may be necessary to
the ends of justice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The witness is next to consider, what is and what
is not evidence: we cannot follow this subject in all
its bearings, nor indeed is it here necessary, a few
points must however be remembered; and first of
notes; these if taken upon the spot or immediately
after a transaction, may be used by the witness to
refresh his memory; and as to dates, numbers, or
quantities, it is generally expedient to have them;
the notes should be original, not copies; if there be
any point in them which the witness does not recollect
except that he finds it there, such point is not evidence,
for the notes are only to assist recollection not to
convey information.</p>

<p class='c000'>The witness must relate only that which he himself
has seen or observed; that which he has heard from
others is not evidence as coming from him; except
indeed where some expressions or declarations of the
parties concerned have become a part of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res gesta</span></i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>but the declarations of a dying man are evidence
when related by a third person on oath, though the
party making them was not sworn, for the law
presumes that the solemnity of the occasion may
dispense with the form, and that a man, trembling on
the brink of eternity, will never risk salvation by
falsehood. To give this weight to a declaration, it
is necessary that the party should believe himself to
be dying; Mr. Justice <i>Bailey</i>, is reported to have
said, that the party must be satisfied that recovery
was impossible: we think the reporter must have
been mistaken; for such a rule would exclude all
such declarations; hope is the latest faculty of the
human mind. “I am better,” has not unfrequently
been the last articulation of expiring nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>How far and in what cases opinion is evidence, is
next to be considered; in ordinary matters where,
from a statement of facts, the jury, in the exercise of
sound and ordinary understanding, are capable of
arriving at a just conclusion, the opinion of a witness
is neither requisite or admissible; but in matters of
science it is otherwise, provided that he backs his
opinion by such reason as may be satisfactory to the
understanding of his hearers; and this is the principal
qualification of a medical witness, that he make
himself <em>intelligible to ordinary comprehensions</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>No man is bound to give any evidence by which
he may render himself liable to any criminal prosecution.
At the Old Bailey Sessions, in June, 1821,
Mr. <i>George Patmore</i> was tried for the murder of <i>John
Scott</i>, in a duel. Mr. <i>Pettigrew</i>, (a surgeon,) was
the first witness called.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Justice <i>Bailey</i>.—Mr. <i>Pettigrew</i>, I think it necessary
to give you this caution, if you think the evidence,
which you are about to give likely to expose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>you to a criminal prosecution, you are not bound to
give it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. <i>Pettigrew</i>. My Lord, I am not competent to
form any opinion of my legal guilt; I have not taken
the part of principal or second. The part which I
have taken was merely to exercise my professional
duty; in that I do not think there is any moral guilt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Justice <i>Bailey</i>. If you went (knowing a duel
was to take place) for the purpose of giving surgical
assistance, I apprehend that you are liable to a criminal
prosecution.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. <i>Pettigrew</i>. Then, my Lord, I must decline
answering any questions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Justice <i>Bailey</i>. I recollect having seen a
surgeon of eminence tried in this court, on a similar
occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Neither Mr. <i>Pettigrew</i>, nor his assistant, were
examined.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. <i>Darling</i>, who had attended the deceased after
he had received his wound, deposed that he heard
Mr. <i>Scott</i> on his death bed say——</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Justice <i>Bailey</i>. Did Mr. <i>Scott</i> at that time think
himself in danger: did he give up all hopes of recovery?</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. <i>Darling</i>. No. To the last he entertained
hopes of recovery.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Justice <i>Bailey</i>. The declaration made by a
dying man cannot be received as evidence, unless the
party at the time of making it were satisfied that
recovery was impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have before noticed the limitation with which
we believe this supposed rule must be taken.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the exception of dying declarations, all
evidence in criminal matters, must be upon oath,
therefore the affirmation of a quaker cannot be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>received on a coroners inquest.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c011'><sup>[234]</sup></a> In the too celebrated
case of the Oldham Inquest on the body of John Lees,
Mr. <i>Earnshaw</i>, a quaker surgeon,<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c011'><sup>[235]</sup></a> who had attended
the deceased, though much urged refused to be sworn,
and his testimony was consequently rejected; a paper
was subsequently delivered to the jury, containing
the matter of his observation; this was very properly
resented by the Coroner, as an illegal attempt to
influence the jury, who by their oaths were bound to
admit no information which wanted that legal sanction.
While we were writing this article we were surprised
to find that a Coroner for the County of Surry had
permitted the letter of a Physician to be read to the
jury, as evidence that a person deceased was of
unsound mind; and on this evidence, (for we can
scarcely suppose that the servants deposition to rheumatic
headaches, was allowed to weigh,) a verdict of
insanity was returned: we shall have subsequent
occasion to comment on this <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mala miserecordia</span></i>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>OF MARRIAGE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As both our civil and religious institutions consider
the matrimonial union as a necessary preliminary<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c011'><sup>[236]</sup></a>
to the legal propagation of our species, this
as far as it is connected with medical science, will
form the first subject of enquiry, in which we are to
investigate who are and who are not capable of contracting
this relation.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c011'><sup>[237]</sup></a> And this being a point
originally of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, we shall in its
examination, follow the order of the civilians, so far
as it is necessary to our purpose; we shall accordingly
consider the capacity of persons to contract
marriage in respect of age, mental capacity, and corporeal
fitness. Another question arises from consanguinity;
and this though neither founded in nor determinable
by medical evidence, may deserve a moment’s
attention, since it is evident that the prohibition of
marriage to certain degrees of kindred, though it may
not have been suggested by physiological reasoning, is
well warranted by it. Experience demonstrates both
in the human and brute creation,<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c011'><sup>[238]</sup></a> that a race continually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>bred through the same blood without admixture
of a foreign stock, becomes small, weak, and degenerate;
this is a fact too well known to the agriculturist
in breeding cattle to require further observation.
And it is fatally displayed in the royal and
noble families of some foreign countries, whose policy
has been supposed to require frequent intermarriages,
and whose princes and nobles are thence
distinguished from their countrymen by their animal,
and frequently by their mental inferiority. Those
who have travelled in the south of Europe will not be
at a loss for examples in elucidation of this principle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many questions may arise on the first point; for,
though the Act of the 26th of <i>George</i> 2. <i>cap.</i> 33. commonly
called the Marriage Act, has fixed the age of
twenty-one years<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c011'><sup>[239]</sup></a> as the period in both sexes before
which this contract cannot legally take effect by
the mere act of the parties. Other points may still
arise as to the age at which marriage may take place,
the statuable precautions of banns or licence having
been complied with.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to the canon law and the doctrines of
precontracts (now exploded)<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c011'><sup>[240]</sup></a> or rather from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>abuse of both, infants of the most tender age were
formerly betrothed to each other; and this precontract
they were considered as bound to complete and
perform when they should arrive at a sufficient age;
the civil law indeed says,<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c011'><sup>[241]</sup></a> “though spousals are
not limited to any age, yet infancy is not esteemed in
the calculation: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">id est si non sint minores quam septem
annis</span></i>”<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c011'><sup>[242]</sup></a>. Our law however appears, and with
good reason, to have fixed upon the supposed age of
puberty, fourteen for boys, and twelve for girls, as
the earliest period at which marriage should be contracted.
Yet even these relative ages, though somewhat
too tender either for public policy or domestic
happiness, are not invariably the times of puberty;
in some instances it is anticipated, in many delayed.
If therefore the law of England, in this as in most
other matters of Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, follows
the Canon law, which “pays a greater regard to
the constitution than the age of the parties; for if
they are <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habiles ad matrimonium</span></i> it is a good marriage,
whatever their age may be,” it becomes an
important medical question to consider who are and
who are not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habiles ad matrimonium</span></i> in respect of
nonage.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>It is equally, or perhaps more important, that the
parties be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habiles ad consensus</span></i>, in respect of mental
capacity; for though in an old case <i>Style</i> and <i>West</i>,
3 <i>James</i> 1. <i>Roll. Ab.</i> 357, it was held that an idiot
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a nativitate</span></i>, might consent to marriage<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c011'><sup>[243]</sup></a>, by later
resolutions it has been determined otherwise, because
consent is necessary to marriage, and idiots are not
capable of consenting to any thing, so also of a lunatic,
unless the marriage was in a lucid interval. But
as it may be difficult to prove the exact state of the
party’s mind at the actual celebration of the nuptials,
therefore the statute 15 <i>Geo.</i> 2. <i>c.</i> 30. has provided
that the marriage of lunatics and persons under phrenzies,
(if found<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c011'><sup>[244]</sup></a> lunatics under a commission, or
committed to trustees by any Act of Parliament) before
they are declared of sound mind by the Lord
Chancellor or the majority of such trustees, shall be
totally void. 2 <i>Burn. Eccl. Law</i> 416. 1 <i>Bl. Com.</i> 439.
<cite>Collinson on Lunatics</cite>, 554.</p>

<p class='c000'>Persons deaf and dumb may contract marriage, for
they can give their consent by signs: 2 <i>Burn. Eccl.
Law</i>, 415. <i>Swinb. s.</i> 15. 3 <i>Potier</i>, 165.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c011'><sup>[245]</sup></a> but it is
essential, that they should be competent in all other
respects, for there must always be a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</span></i> suspicion
that a person born deaf and dumb, by absence
of the ordinary means of instruction, must be of imperfect
capacity.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c011'><sup>[246]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>The third consideration is whether the parties are
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habiles ad procreandos liberos</span></i> in respect of corporeal
ability, for that being the ultimate use and intention
of marriage, the contract cannot be good unless the
parties are in the condition of performing it;<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c011'><sup>[247]</sup></a> except
indeed where the incapacity arises from old age;
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">volenti non fit injuria</span></i>, and though neither the law of
the land, nor the law of nature has, as far as it is
known to us, prescribed any well-defined limit to the
generative capacity,<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c011'><sup>[248]</sup></a> yet after a certain period it
may at least be so far doubtful as to create an implied
waiver between the contracting parties.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c011'><sup>[249]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Some foreign jurists and schoolmen have maintained,
that the institution being solely <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad procreandos
liberos</span></i>, it is a profanation of the rite to celebrate it
between parties incapable;<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c011'><sup>[250]</sup></a> but this doctrine is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>repelled by our liturgy, which even prescribes the
omission of the prayer for procreation where the woman
is past the age of childbearing;<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c011'><sup>[251]</sup></a> how the priest
is to ascertain this point we leave the civilians to determine.</p>

<p class='c000'>But a much more material question of medico-legal
policy arises, as to the marriages of those who are
afflicted with some serious hereditary disorder, or predisposition
to disorder,<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c011'><sup>[252]</sup></a> as <i>Scrofula</i>, <i>Mania</i>, &amp;c.<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c011'><sup>[253]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>in such cases public policy might induce an absolute
prohibition,<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c011'><sup>[254]</sup></a> but humanity would pause before it added
this bann of excommunication to the misfortunes
of its object; a middle course might be adopted:
Mahon<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c011'><sup>[255]</sup></a> says that the Protestant church admits
epilepsy as a good cause of divorce, and that <i>Alberti</i>
has handed down a decision of the faculty of Halle on
this subject; we do not know any English case on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>the point, and very much doubt whether our ecclesiastical
courts would admit the principle; unless
indeed it were made out, that the disorder constituted
a moral impotence, or that one of the parties
could not perform the contract but at the risk of life.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Fernelius</span> is of opinion that old people beget
weak and diseased children, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Senes et Valetudinarii
imbecilles filios vitiosa constitutione gignunt</span></i>.” <span class='sc'>Portal</span>
supports the same opinion, and thinks that the older
people are when they have children, the more likely
they are to have acquired imbecillity or disease, and
to transmit the same to their children, from whom
they may become hereditary, (<i>Portal</i>, “<cite>Sur la nature
et traitement de quelques maladies hereditaires ou de
famille</cite>”). This is altogether a popular error; what
innumerable instances, says Dr. Adams, might be
cited, in which the younger branch of a family has
revived its splendour, which had been decaying for a
succession of ages: the late Mr. Pitt was the youngest
son, born when his illustrious father was in the fifty-first
year of his age.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>OF DIVORCE OR NULLITY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>If either of the parties professing to contract marriage
be at the time defective in the points enumerated
in the preceding section, it is a good ground of
divorce; but to establish such defect, and especially
the defect of corporeal ability, the strongest evidence
must be adduced,<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c011'><sup>[256]</sup></a> not merely on the general
maxim that the best possible evidence which the case
will allow must always be produced, but also as the
particular fact to be proved is or may be contrary to
the general order of nature, and therefore requires
more than ordinary proof for its establishment: to
such points therefore the medical practitioner is required
to give his most sedulous attention, first to the
question in the abstract, contrasting his own experience
with the opinions and traditions which he may
find upon the subject, and divesting his mind of all
speculative and theoretical doctrines which he does
not find supported by well authenticated facts; thus
prepared his second object will be an attentive, accurate,
and scientific examination of the immediate case
in question. The defect may be mental<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c011'><sup>[257]</sup></a> or corporeal;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>thus it may proceed from antipathy to a particular
woman, when it has been called <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">impotentiam</span></i> or
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">maleficium erga hanc</span></i>; this was the alleged case of the
Earl of Essex, in the time of <i>James</i> the 1st; for which
see 1 <i>Harg. St. Tri.</i> 315: 2 <i>How. St. Tri.</i> 786.; and
for the very curious argument and narative of <i>Abbot</i>,
Archbishop of Canterbury, see 10 <i>Harg. St. Tri. Appendix</i>,
p. 4. How far this case may be depended on,
except as a beacon to show us what we ought to avoid,
may be exceedingly doubtful. The character of the
Lady Essex, afterward infamous as Countess of Somerset
for the murder of Sir <i>Thomas Overbury</i>, may
lead us to suspect every species of imposition and
falsehood. The Judges, according to the testimony of
their coadjutor the Archbishop, had predetermined
to decide in favor of the divorce; no sufficient evidence
appears to have been required or received, and
the king, making himself at once the advocate and
partisan of his unworthy favourite, urged the business
with an indecent and arbitrary heat. From the worst
of the <i>Stuarts</i>, and the pedantic believer in witchcraft
(for <i>maleficium</i><a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c011'><sup>[258]</sup></a> was then used in this sense) such
conduct was not extraordinary; in the present day
we may boast with confidence that similar interference
would be impossible. With these defects, the case
of the Earl of Essex can be of little or no use to the
medical jurist; and unfortunately we have no other
which is reported with sufficient accuracy or authenticity;
we say unfortunately, because though there
may be much of good policy and correct feeling in
the determination of our Civilians to conceal the detail
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>of such cases from the public eye,<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c011'><sup>[259]</sup></a> yet by
drawing their line too strictly, they run no inconsiderable
risk of totally excluding those lights of
science, of which in so dark and intricate a subject
they must necessarily stand in need. It is true that
the ecclesiastical courts may have the benefit of medical
evidence in every case which is brought before
them, but this evidence will be necessarily imperfect,
unless founded on previous study, and some knowledge
of the points, to which the practice of the
Court will require the witness to direct his attention.
In France, where causes of this kind may perhaps
have been more frequent, and where less reserve is
used than suits our national character, several cases
have been published, for which see the <cite>Collection des
Causes celebres</cite>, and <cite>Bayle’s Dictionary, tit. Quellenec
&amp; Parthenai</cite>, with the references there given.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have stated that the defect of corporeal ability<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c011'><sup>[260]</sup></a>
may proceed from mental or bodily causes; of the
former the instances must be exceedingly rare, and the
latter are certainly not numerous: but the reader will
find the information which he may require upon this
subject in the following physiological illustrations.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>1. OF AGES, ESPECIALLY THAT OF PUBERTY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>As the period of puberty is intimately connected
with the subject of Marriage, and as the age of an
individual has many other important relations with
civil and criminal transactions, we shall take this
occasion to consider the several physiological points
which the subject necessarily comprehends.</p>

<p class='c000'>The age of man is estimated, as it was in the days
of David, at <em>three score years and ten</em>—not more,
however, than one in eighty reaches the tottering
confines of mortality, and it has been correctly stated,
that one half who come into life, leave it again before
the expiration of their <em>eighth</em> year; of a <em>thousand</em>
children born in London, <em>six hundred and fifty</em> die
before the age of <em>ten</em>. It has been computed by
Herodotus, and acknowledged as correct by our ablest
authors on political arithmetic, that three generations
of men pass away in a century, and consequently the
whole human species cannot be said to divide one
with another more than <em>thirty-four</em> years of existence.
The astonishing longevity of the Antediluvians<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c011'><sup>[261]</sup></a>
has given rise to much discussion, but neither the
researches of the learned, nor the reasonings of the
ingenious, have hitherto thrown any light upon the
subject; nor is the question of any importance in
relation to the objects of the present work; the
medical jurist is alone interested in the existing laws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>of mortality, and in those exceptions which may
occur in their general dispensation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The several ages, or stages of man’s existence,
have been differently determined, according to the
particular views which have suggested the division,
especially as they relate to legal or physiological
objects; on the present occasion it is to the latter of
these that we have more particularly to direct our
attention. <i>Aristotle</i> marked three grand and obvious
divisions in our existence, that of <span class='sc'>Growth</span>—that
during which we remain apparently <span class='sc'>Stationary</span>—and
that of <span class='sc'>Decline</span>; each of which has been subdivided
by subsequent authors,<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c011'><sup>[262]</sup></a> so as to constitute
seven ages: thus the stage of Growth includes <i>Infancy</i>,
<i>Second Infancy</i>, or <i>Boyhood</i> (<i>Pueritia</i>) and <i>Adolescence</i>;
the stage, during which we appear to remain
stationary, consists of <i>Youth</i> (<i>Juventus</i>) and <i>Manhood</i>
(<i>Ætas Virilis</i>). The last division—<span class='sc'>Decline</span>,
embraces <i>Old Age</i>, and <i>Decrepitude</i>. The philosophers
and physicians of Greece were led to adopt
several divisions corresponding with their superstitious
reliance on the powers of certain numbers;
<i>Varro</i> divided life into five portions; <i>Solon</i> into ten;
but Hippocrates, Proclus, and the greater number of
the ancient writers acknowledged <span class='sc'>Seven Ages</span>, a
division which has been very generally adopted by
the poets and philosophers of later times; in proof
of the opinion of the former, we may adduce the
testimony of Hippocrates,<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c011'><sup>[263]</sup></a> who says, εν ανθρωπου φυσει επτα εισιν ωραι,
and in confirmation of the truth of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>remark upon those of the latter, we may remind the
reader of the celebrated passage in Shakspeare,<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c011'><sup>[264]</sup></a>
in which the progress of human life is so beautifully
illustrated. The duration of each of these stages has
moreover been considered as under the influence of
the same mystical numbers, and will generally be
found to be a multiple of <em>seven</em>, for the ancient physicians
were persuaded that every period of seven
years effected some material alteration in the human
system; thus <i>Solon</i>, although he divided life into ten
stages, considered each stage as a <i>Septenary</i>;<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c011'><sup>[265]</sup></a> so
with the Canonists there are <em>six</em> ages, but the duration
of each is <em>seven years</em>, or some multiple of that
number; thus, <span class='sc'>Infantia</span> from <em>one</em> to <em>seven</em>; <span class='sc'>Pueritia</span>
from <em>seven</em> to <em>fourteen</em>;—<span class='sc'>Adolescentia</span> from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>fourteen to <em>twenty-eight</em>;<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c011'><sup>[266]</sup></a>—<span class='sc'>Juventus</span> from <em>twenty-eight</em>
to <em>fifty</em>; (Quere, <i>Forty-nine</i>?)—<span class='sc'>Ætas Senilis</span>
from <em>fifty</em> to <em>seventy</em>;—<span class='sc'>Senectus</span> from Seventy.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c011'><sup>[267]</sup></a>—Before
we quit the conceits of the Numerists,
we may state that in their notions the number
<em>Nine</em> was supposed to possess some mystic power in
relation to our ages; and for this reason, superstition
has attached considerable apprehension to the age of
<em>sixty-three</em>, in as much as being the multiple of both the
numbers so important to our existence, viz. 9 × 7<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c011'><sup>[268]</sup></a>.
This period of life has accordingly been anticipated
with fear, and passed with exultation; a conceit,
which has been perpetuated in our own times, under
the imposing title of the <i>Grand Climacteric of Life</i>,
while its antiquity is shewn by the memorable letter
of <span class='sc'>Augustus</span> to his nephew <span class='sc'>Caius</span>, in which he
encourages him to celebrate his nativity as he had
escaped <em>sixty-three</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall now proceed to consider the <span class='sc'>Seven Ages</span>
of man in detail.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Infancy</span>—<i>Infantia</i>—(from <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Infari</span></i>, not able to
speak) commences at birth, and terminates at the
<em>seventh</em> year. The signs by which the age of an
infant may be computed, are derived from its moral
as well as physical characters; and as circumstances
connected with medico-judicial inquiries may render
the problem of importance, we shall proceed to
offer some data that may assist its solution. The
feebleness and size of the infant; its epidermis yet
reddish, and wrinkled; its face covered with down;
its head soft, and the <i>fontanelles</i> greatly extended;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the eye but little sensible to light, and lastly the
appearance of the navel, are circumstances which
will at once lead the medical practitioner to the conclusion
of its not being many days old; while its
smiles and tears, its upright posture in the nurses
arms, the thickness and whiteness of the skin, the
plumpness of its thighs and buttocks, the eagerness
with which its eyes seek and follow brilliant objects,
its agitation on the occurrence of noisy sounds, and
its eager desire for the breast, are occurrences which
will, according to the force and degree of each,
announce the child’s progress towards the <em>third</em>,
<em>fourth</em>, or <em>fifth</em> month. The pleasure which it testifies
at the sight of its nurse, its jealousies, and
other passions, the habit of carrying its fingers and
different objects to its mouth, the facility and pleasure
with which it chews bread, and the copious
discharge of saliva, announce the approach of dentition,
and assure us that the infant must be in its
seventh month. The progress of dentition will at
this period afford some farther data; towards the
end of the <em>seventh</em> month the middle <span class='sc'>Incisor</span> teeth of
the inferior jaw perforate the texture of the gums;
and soon afterwards the corresponding <span class='sc'>Incisors</span> of
the upper maxilla make their appearance; then the
lateral <span class='sc'>Incisors</span> of the inferior, and subsequently
those of the superior jaw; about the <em>twelfth</em> or <em>fourteenth</em>
month, sometimes sooner, the first of the
<span class='sc'>Molares</span> of the under, then the corresponding teeth
of the upper jaw appear; the four <span class='sc'>Cuspidati</span> are
usually protruded through the gum the last; thus the
<span class='sc'>Cuspidati</span> and the second <span class='sc'>Molares</span> will sometimes
appear at the same time, and this is usually between
the <em>twentieth</em> and <em>twenty-fifth</em> month; so that at, or
soon after <em>two years</em> of age, the twenty temporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>or <em>milk</em> teeth<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c011'><sup>[269]</sup></a> are to be found in situ. It must
however be remembered that the formation and appearance
of the <em>milk</em> teeth are subject to considerable
variety, and there are some examples on record,
though very uncommon, of children born with two
Incisors in the upper maxilla, but such teeth have
been found to be imperfect in their structure, and
without fangs, and they have consequently soon been
detached; in other cases, children, although enjoying
perfect health, have not cut a single tooth until the
end of their second year. Nor are the other signs to
which we have alluded, as affording indications of the
age, to be considered as immutable; the infant may
have been more or less retarded, or accelerated in its
march of developement by its state of health and
vigour, and it deserves remark, that scrophulous and
<em>rickety</em> children very commonly present an aspect of
intellectual precocity, by no means commensurate
with their age; and hence the popular notion has
arisen, that very intelligent children rarely continue
to live. The fact of this premature expansion of the
mind is too apparent to be doubted; but philosophers
have endeavoured to explain it upon very different
principles; the physiologist has sought the cause
from some peculiarity in the organization of the body,
while the moralist has attempted to account for it by
supposing that in consequence of the inability of these
subjects to partake of the sports and exercises suitable
to their years, they necessarily enjoy more of
the instructive society of their parents and preceptors.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Pueritia</span>—<i>Second Infancy</i>—<i>Boy-hood</i>. At about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>the age of <em>Seven</em> years, <em>Detentition</em>, or the shedding
of the temporary or milk teeth commonly commences,
in order to make room for the adult set; and this
event is considered as marking the arrival of the second
epoch, and which, in its turn, is terminated at
<em>fourteen</em> or <em>fifteen</em> in boys, and at <em>twelve</em> or <em>thirteen</em> in
girls, by that peculiar change which the constitution
undergoes, and which we have hereafter to consider
under the head of Puberty. Persons of this second
age are called <i>Pueri</i>, or <i>Impuberes</i>, not being considered
as yet in possession of the complete powers
of reason, although they may be allowed to possess
some faint ideas with regard to the customs and habits
of society; their memory is also most clear and
comprehensive, but it soon becomes governed by the
imagination.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Adolescence</span> or <i>Puberty</i>.—This important and
tumultuous epoch of our existence commences at
about fourteen in males, and at twelve in females,
and ends at twenty-one, or later according to constitution,
habit, and climate. The body having nearly
completed its stature, its powers of growth are directed
into other channels; and in the male, the
beard begins to sprout; the voice becomes fuller,
deeper, and more sonorous;<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c011'><sup>[270]</sup></a> the parts of generation
acquire the magnitude which they afterwards
preserve, and become shaded with hair; the whole
volume of the body augments, and at the same time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>assumes a character so decidedly masculine, as at
once to proclaim the sex of the individual in whom
it appears; in addition to these general changes, the
secretion of the seminal liquor by the testicles commences,
and the individual thus irritated by new desires,
soon distinguishes the means of gratifying them,
and the <em>life of the species</em> may be said to commence its
existence. Nor are the moral changes which take
place less remarkable, or less characteristic of the
period of puberty than those which appertain to his
physical condition; his mind acquires increased tone,
and his manners and habits assume a more manly
character; these changes however do not immediately
succeed, and we are much inclined to admit
with <i>Zacchias</i><a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c011'><sup>[271]</sup></a> the existence of three gradations
in Adolescence, <i>Incipient</i> Puberty (at about <em>fourteen</em>),
Puberty (from <em>seventeen</em> to <em>twenty</em>), and
<em>Perfect Puberty</em> (from <em>twenty</em> to <em>twenty-five</em>). These
distinctions are undoubtedly founded in nature, and
are admissible both in relation to sexual and intellectual
maturity. Important changes likewise occur
at this critical age, with respect to the extinction or
kindling of disease; in cases of hereditary predisposition,
the particular malady will frequently remain
dormant until the age of puberty; this is particularly
evinced in maniacal affections,<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c011'><sup>[272]</sup></a> in consumption,
and other scrophulous diseases. The phenomena
which attend the accession of puberty in females are
not less remarkable than those which we have described
as occurring in males; and although there is
neither the change of voice, nor the production of
hair on the face, so remarkable in the other sex, yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>the body enlarges in volume, the breasts swell with
exuberance, and the excess of vitality no longer required
for general growth, invests her limbs with
those rounded and graceful forms, which have so universally
constituted the theme of the poet, and the
admiration and study of the artist: but the most remarkable
change which the female system undergoes
at this period is indicated by the commencement of a
periodical sanguineous discharge<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c011'><sup>[273]</sup></a> from the vessels of
the uterus, and which from the monthly interval that
it observes has received the name of <i>Menses</i>. The
period of life at which this change takes place is under
the control of various moral and physical circumstances,
as climate, temperament of the individual,
habits of living,<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c011'><sup>[274]</sup></a> &amp;c. In tropical climates puberty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>takes place at an earlier period than in northern latitudes;
in Greece, the Corea, Indostan, and Java,
girls begin to menstruate at eight, nine, or ten; in
Spain, Sicily, and the Southern part of Europe, at
twelve; but advancing to the northern climes, there
is a gradual protraction of the time until we come to
Lapland, where women do not menstruate till they
arrive at a maturer age, and then in small quantities,
at long intervals, and sometimes only in summer.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c011'><sup>[275]</sup></a>
This difference in the time of life at which puberty
takes place, has been ingeniously assigned by <i>David
Hume</i> as the reason why women in hot climates are
almost universally treated as slaves; and why, on the
contrary, their influence is so powerful and extensive in
colder regions; for in the former, woman may be said
to be in the zenith of her beauty while she is yet a child
in understanding, and long before her intellect is matured
she ceases to be an object of love; but in temperate
countries her personal charms and intellectual
endowments are simultaneous in their progress
to perfection; the united force of her beauty and
mental qualities is irresistible, and man voluntarily
pays to her the homage which her powers are so well
calculated to command<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c011'><sup>[276]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are, moreover, many cases on record<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c011'><sup>[277]</sup></a>, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>which both males and females have prematurely arrived
at the stage of puberty; a most remarkable instance
of this precocity is recorded<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c011'><sup>[278]</sup></a> by Mr. Anthony
White, in the history of Philip Howorth, and the author
of the present work can bear testimony to the
correctness of the statement, for he had frequent opportunities
of seeing him, and of tracing from time
to time the constitutional changes which so rapidly
succeeded each other in the first two years of his existence.
Dr. Wall has presented us with a similar
instance of precocity in a female infant, in whom the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>menstrual flux appeared at the age of nine months<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c011'><sup>[279]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Various methods have, at different times, been
adopted for determining the age of puberty. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>sect of ancient Roman lawyers, called <i>Cassiani</i>, fixed
it by the state of the body, which <i>Justinian</i> and others
after him suppose to have been done by a personal
examination, at least in the male sex; for as to the
female it is pretended that the twelfth year was the
only guide; though others allege that the eruption
of the menses served instead of it. The <i>Proculiari</i>,
on the contrary determined the puberty of males by
the expiration of the fourteenth year. <i>Javolenus</i> pursued
a middle course, and made use of both methods.<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c011'><sup>[280]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The phenomena of puberty depend, in both sexes,
upon the developement of the generative organs; for
whenever this is prevented, or only imperfectly produced,
a corresponding character is impressed upon
the individual, as we see so well exemplified in the
appearance of eunuchs<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c011'><sup>[281]</sup></a>. In females, however, the
uterus does not appear to be the essential organ which
impresses the sex with its distinctive peculiarities:
<i>Van Helmont</i> has said “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Propter solum uterum mulier
est, id quod est</span></i>”——but Dr. <i>Caillot</i> has shewn in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>second volume of the <cite>Medical Society of Paris</cite> that a
woman may grow up with all the external appearances
and attributes of her sex, and yet have no uterus;
numerous cases of a similar kind are upon record,
to some of which we shall have occasion hereafter
to allude: the same facts do not hold good in
relation to the <i>Ovaria</i>; their developement, like that
of the testicles in the male, seems to be absolutely
essential to the perfection of the sex. A very interesting
case,<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c011'><sup>[282]</sup></a> in illustration of this truth, is afforded
by Mr. <i>C. Pears</i>; in which account all the characters
belonging to the female after puberty were absent;
her breasts never enlarged, she never menstruated,
no hair appeared on the pubes, and she died at the
age of twenty-nine; when upon dissection the <i>Ovaries</i>
were found wanting; the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">os tincæ</span></i> and uterus had
their usual form, but never increased beyond their
size in the infant state.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Juventus</span>—<i>Youth</i>.—This succeeds to <a id='adol'></a>adolescence,
and in its turn is replaced by manhood. If the law
does not acknowledge this stage of life, it at least tacitly
allows it, as being the one best adapted for the
vigorous discharge of public duties; it is the age at
which the greatest enterprizes have been achieved,
and the most brilliant efforts of human genius fulfilled;
the developement of the body having been accomplished,
its powers are expanded in the production
and support of intellectual energies. The action of
the arterial system may be said to predominate over
every other, and hence the diseases to which man is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>exposed in this stage of his existence are of an acute
and inflammatory character. To the common observer
his march of life would seem to be arrested, little
material change, either of a moral or physical nature,
is discernible from the age of twenty-five to thirty-five;
and this period may therefore be said to occupy
a part of the second great division of Aristotle to
which we have alluded (the period of <i>Perennity</i>.)</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Ætas Virilis</span>—<i>Manhood</i>. Youth passes into
manhood by such insensible shades of gradation, that
it has been considered as only a continuation of the
same stage of perennity; and yet we shall find that
the change from one to the other is sufficiently striking
to entitle them to distinct places in the scale.
Hippocrates and Galen have compared youth to the
summer, and manhood to the autumn, thus insinuating
that if one be less fervent, it is yet more mature
than the other; and this is certainly morally and physiologically
true; for although the imagination loses
much of its glowing fervour, its dominion is succeeded
by that of a maturer judgment; the arterial system
no longer predominates over every other, its energies
have been reduced, and a juster equipoise established;
the diseases, therefore, to which he is liable
assume a different aspect,<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c011'><sup>[283]</sup></a> and maladies of a chronic
character prevail, and thus while in the apparent
plenitude of his existence is he fast journeying to his
destined goal;<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c011'><sup>[284]</sup></a> man never stands still, he is either
progressing to the zenith of his strength and vigour,
or he is declining from it; in vain shall we attempt to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>cast our anchor in the stream of life, it will alike carry
away those who struggle against it, and those who
yield quietly to the force of the current; the panaceas
and boasted elixirs, and the many other means
which have been proposed to renovate the body, are
as chimerical, says Buffon, as the fountain of youth
is fabulous.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Senectus</span>—<i>Old Age</i>. The system has now undergone
a considerable change; its bony framework has
acquired increased solidity and density; the vascular
system is greatly abridged in the extent and subtlety
of its ramifications; the muscles become less irritable,
their fatty matter is absorbed, the cellular structure
collapses, and the whole volume of the body diminishing.</p>

      <div class='line'>Into the lean and slippered pantaloon;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The skin also wrinkles, particularly in the forehead
and face; the hair turns grey, and afterwards
white; all the senses lose their acuteness, the heart
and arterial system are diminished in force; while
the venous system is in a state of plethora; and hence
this stage of life is exposed to diseases of a peculiar
cast: the blood-vessels are also liable to ossific depositions,
from which apoplexy, and various affections
of the heart and other organs, arise; the faculty
of reproducing the species ceases long before
the natural termination of his existence, although
the period at which his organs fail is more precarious
and less definite than that at which they commenced
their functions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Woman, in relation to her powers of propagation,
may be said to anticipate the male sex in her advancement
to old age; at the period of forty-five or fifty,
the menstrual discharge ceases, and a change is produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>in the system, called the <em>turn of life</em>, which
renders women at this age subject to many diseases to
which a great number fall victims; but when this
dangerous time has passed, their life is even more
secure, and a probability exists of its being protracted
beyond that of a man of equal age; and although
the breasts become flaccid, the fleshy contour of the
body diminishes, and the skin forms wrinkles, yet
her mental powers retain their full vigour for a considerable
period, and her decline into the vale of years
is distinguished by a steady cheerfulness which contributes,
in no small degree, to divest the path of its
thorns, if not to prolong its duration.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Decrepitudo</span>—<i>Advanced Age</i>. At length the limbs
fail under the burthen which for so many years they had
sustained with ease; the exterior muscles gradually
return to that state of debility in which they were during
infancy, and being unable to sustain a continued
state of contraction, relieve themselves by alternate
intervals of relaxation, from which arise the tremors<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c011'><sup>[285]</sup></a>
so characteristic of old persons; upon the same principle
is to be explained the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vacillatio Senilis</span></i>, (see-saw)
for by these motions the muscles which preserve the
perpendicularity of the body, are alternately quiescent,
and exerted; and are thus less liable to fatigue
or exhaustion.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c011'><sup>[286]</sup></a> The teeth having successively
dropped out of their sockets, the alveolar processes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>are absorbed, and the projection of the lower beyond
the upper jaw, imparts a very peculiar physiognomy
to the countenance.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>2. OF IMPOTENCE AND STERILITY.</h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c012'>1. <i>IMPOTENCE.</i></h4>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Impotence</span>, or the incapacity of sexual intercourse,
and <span class='sc'>Sterility</span>, or the inability of procreation,
are subjects which frequently become questions
in the Ecclesiastical Courts, as relating to the performance
and dissolution of the marriage contract;
and as medical evidence is generally required upon
such occasions, the subjects necessarily present themselves
for discussion in the present work.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Impotence</span> may exist either in the male or female.
<span class='sc'>Sterility</span> is confined to the female, for if the male
be proved capable of accomplishing the act of coition,
no farther question can arise as to his virility.</p>

<p class='c000'>Impotence may be <em>Absolute</em> or <em>Relative</em>, that is to
say, the parties may be incapable of cohabiting with
each other, and yet they may each accomplish the
venereal congress, and enjoy a fruitful intercourse
with others; it may also be <em>functional</em> or <em>organic</em>,
and depend either upon <em>physical</em> or <em>moral</em> causes;
and hence in some cases it may be <em>temporary</em>, in
others <em>permanent</em>, and upon this point the evidence
of the medical practitioner will be always very
essential. It is therefore important that we should
proceed to investigate the subject in its various relations
to those different causes.</p>

<h5 class='c012'>1. <i>Organic Causes of Impotence.</i></h5>
<h6 class='c012'>IN MALES.</h6>

<p class='c013'>There was a period in the history of physiology,
when the testicles were not considered essential
to virility. Aristotle was led to such a conclusion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>from having observed that a bull was capable
of impregnating the female after castration; a
fact which depended upon the quantity of semen,
retained in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vesiculæ seminales</span></i>, conferring fertility
upon a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">coitus</span></i> which took place immediately
after the operation. The true theory of the functions
of the testicles having been thus abandoned, it was
necessary to substitute some other explanation of
their use, and the Naturalist of Stagira has accordingly
asserted, that they merely serve as weights to
hinder the spermatic vessels from being folded up;
an hypothesis which, absurd as it is, has found advocates
in the later schools; and in its support we
shall find many experiments and cases related by
<i>Marchetti</i> of Padua.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c011'><sup>[287]</sup></a> <i>Sabbatier</i><a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c011'><sup>[288]</sup></a> observes,
that subjects have been found who have only possessed
one testicle, and what is more extraordinary,
that there are others who although entirely destitute
of these organs, have exhibited the other parts of
generation in their natural state; in proof of which
<i>Cabrolio</i> mentions the case of a soldier addicted to
sexual pleasures, in whose body no testicles were
found, although the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vesiculæ seminales</span></i> were distended
with semen. <i>Scurigio</i><a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c011'><sup>[289]</sup></a> and <i>Lieutaud</i><a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c011'><sup>[290]</sup></a> refer to
the same case; upon which <i>Portal</i><a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c011'><sup>[291]</sup></a> very justly
observes, that the soldier was doubtless furnished
with testicles, but which, from their unnatural situation,
probably escaped the notice of <i>Cabrolio</i>. The
extraordinary situations in which the testicles may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>be found are fully detailed by <i>Rinlaender</i>;<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c011'><sup>[292]</sup></a> their
absence from the scrotum does not necessarily imply
impotence; they are formed in the cavity of the
abdomen, and until the sixth month, lie immediately
below the kidneys on the fore part of the Psoæ
muscles, after which period they gradually descend
towards the abdominal ring, through which they
generally pass into the scrotum before birth; but it
occasionally happens that this descent, in regard to
one or both testicles, does not take place until a late
period, and in some instances they remain within the
cavity of the abdomen during life;<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c011'><sup>[293]</sup></a> in such a case, a
question has arisen as to the virility or impotence of
the individual so situated, and upon which medical
opinion would seem to be still unsettled. <i>Foderé</i>
states that such persons have even been remarkable
for their vigour; for these organs, says he, appear to
derive greater power of secretion from the warm bath
in which they lie, than when they have descended
into their natural situation. Mr. <i>John Hunter</i> has
given a very different opinion, and one which appears
to be more compatible with the sound doctrines of
physiology; he believes that when both testicles
remain through life in the belly, they are exceedingly
imperfect, and incapable of performing the natural
functions of these organs; and that it is such imperfection
in structure which prevents the disposition for
their descent taking place; an opinion in which
<i>Zacchias</i> and <i>Riolan</i> entirely concur. Mr. <i>Wilson</i><a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c011'><sup>[294]</sup></a>
observes that he is acquainted with one case that
confirms, and another that would to a certain degree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>refute this opinion; and this is probably the true
state of the question; each case must rest upon its
individual merits, and the practitioner, whose opinion
is desired upon such an occasion, must carefully
inquire into every moral and physical circumstance
that can, collaterally, assist his judgment; such as the
general appearance, <em>soprano</em> voice, and effeminate
physiognomy, of the individual, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">frustra enim ætas
advenit, si testes defuerint; manebit enim etiam virili
ætate fæminæ similis</span></i>.”<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c011'><sup>[295]</sup></a> But the absence of the
testicles in the scrotum may depend upon other and
less equivocal circumstances, they may have been
removed by excision (<i>Eunuchs</i>), in which case there
will be no difficulty in ascertaining the fact by the
appearance of the cicatrix: or they may have been
actually absorbed by an operation of Nature, after considerable
inflammatory action. Mr. John <i>Hunter</i><a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c011'><sup>[296]</sup></a>
has given an account of three cases in which such a
result occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>It does not appear that <em>two</em> testicles are essential
to virility, although the Parliament of Paris in 1665
decreed that the matrimonial contract should not be
deemed valid unless <em>two</em> testicles were evident; it is
now generally admitted that persons with only one
(<i>Monorchides</i>) are fully capable of procreation.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has occurred to Dr. <i>Baillie</i>,<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c011'><sup>[297]</sup></a> and other anatomists,
to observe the testicles exceedingly small, “I
have known,” says this distinguished pathologist,
“one case in a person of middle age, where each of
them was not larger than the extremity of the finger
of an adult; this, as appeared from its history, arose
from a fault in the original formation, and was attended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>with a total want of the natural propensities.”
Mr. <i>Wilson</i>,<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c011'><sup>[298]</sup></a> on the other hand, relates a case that
would induce us to pause before we pronounced judgment
on such an occasion: “I was,” says he, “some
years ago consulted by a gentleman, on the point of
marriage, respecting the propriety of his entering that
state, as his penis and testicles very little exceeded
in size those of a youth of eight years of age. He
was then six and twenty, but never had felt the desire
for sexual intercourse until he became acquainted
with his intended wife; since that period, he had experienced
repeated erections, attended with nocturnal
emissions; he married, became the father of a family,
and these parts which at six and twenty years of age
were so much smaller than usual, at twenty-eight
had increased nearly to the usual size of those of an
adult man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The structure of the testicle may be defective; Mr.
<i>John Hunter</i> has given a representation,<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c011'><sup>[299]</sup></a> in his
work on the Animal Œconomy, of a case in which the
<i>Epididymis</i>, instead of passing to a <i>Vas deferens</i>, terminated
in a cul-de-sac; with such a structure it is
evident that the semen cannot be evacuated by the
urethra, and that the individual must therefore be incurably
impotent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The structure of these organs may be so destroyed
by a bruise, as to occasion impotence. This was formerly
the mode adopted in the oriental courts for
destroying masculine efficiency in the attendants of
the Haram; and it is said that the Algerines, who are
unwilling to castrate their horses, have recourse to
this process, in order to render them incapable of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>procreation;<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c011'><sup>[300]</sup></a> while it is well known that Park-keepers,
who have the management of deer, annul
the power of generating in bucks, by squeezing the
testicles forcibly, and thus destroying their organization
and secerning faculty.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c011'><sup>[301]</sup></a> Atrophy and wasting
of the testicles may also result from local injury; Dr.
<i>Pihorel</i><a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c011'><sup>[302]</sup></a> relates an interesting case of this kind that
occurred to an old soldier.</p>

<p class='c000'>The body of the testicle is liable to many diseases,
by which its structure becomes so changed, and its
delicate organization so obliterated, that its secreting
powers are entirely lost, such as schirrus, cancer,
scrofula, &amp;c. but we are to remember that such affections,
if confined to one testicle, are not to be considered
as affecting the virility of the party. M. <i>Larry</i>,
Inspector General of the French Army, informs us
that a disease which he calls <em>Atrophy of the Testicles</em>
seized many of the troops in their return from Egypt;
by which these organs became soft to the touch, and
gradually diminished in size, without any pain; and
it is well known that persons who are afflicted with
<i>Elephantiasis</i> lose all sexual appetite, and that their
genitals waste.</p>

<p class='c000'>An organic fault similar to that which we have described,
as relating to the <i>Epididymis</i> of the testicle,
sometimes occurs in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vesiculæ Seminales</span></i>, where
instead of entering the urethra, they terminate, after
being joined by the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vasa Deferentia</span></i>, in imperforated
pouches, or cul-de-sacs, producing incurable impotence.
In some cases the spermatic chord becomes
varicose, and is followed by loss of power.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The most common malformation connected with
the penis is the unnatural situation of the orifice of
the urethra; sometimes it opens in the perinæum,
occasionally on the dorsum of the penis, and frequently
underneath. Mr. <i>John Hunter</i> was consulted
by a person, who expressed great anxiety to have
children, but whose urethra opened into the perineum,
he therefore recommended him to inject by
means of a syringe, previously warmed, the semen
into the vagina, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">post coitum</span></i>, and during the existence
of the orgasmus venereus; the wife, it is said, became
pregnant, and Sir E. <i>Home</i> observes, that no doubt
was entertained by Mr. <i>Hunter</i>, or the husband, that
the impregnation was entirely the effect of the experiment.
It would appear that <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">emissio seminis in vaginam</span></i>
is in some cases all that is required for impregnation,
and therefore provided the orifice of the urethra be
situated in a part of the penis that enters the vagina,
any unusual deviation in its direction may not be material;
nay farther, in some instances <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">emissio sine
penetratione</span></i> has appeared sufficient;<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c011'><sup>[303]</sup></a> many cases
are recorded in which the hymen was entire at the
time of delivery;<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c011'><sup>[304]</sup></a> and Dr. <i>Huxham</i><a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c011'><sup>[305]</sup></a> relates an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>instance of pregnancy, where from the preternatural
formation of the female genital organs, it was impossible
that the act of copulation should ever have been
completed. A contracted state of the Prepuce, or
<i>Phymosis</i>, may so interfere with the discharge of the
seminal liquor, as to constitute a cause of impotence,
(<cite>Dyspermatismus Præputialis</cite>, Culleni) an operation,
however, will always in such cases remove the impediment.<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c011'><sup>[306]</sup></a>
By some authors the undue dimensions
of the penis have been classed under the causes of
impotence, but upon this point we would observe
that the case already cited from Mr. <i>Wilson</i>, p. 201,
clearly shews that exception ought not to be taken
against mere diminutiveness<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c011'><sup>[307]</sup></a> of structure; extraordinary
dimensions in length and thickness may certainly
prove a cause of <em>relative</em> impotence; there are
besides certain enlargements in the neighbouring organs
which may afford obstacles to the venereal congress,
as remarkable obesity,<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c011'><sup>[308]</sup></a> scrotal hernia, and
hydrocele.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>It has been a question to what extent the penis
might be mutilated, without the extinction of virility:
repeated instances have occurred where the <i>glans</i> has
been lost, and yet the individual has retained his faculty
of procreation. <i>Piazzoni</i><a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c011'><sup>[309]</sup></a> relates a case
where both the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpora cavernosa</span></i> were destroyed, but
as the canal of the urethra was preserved, the person
could perform the act of coition without difficulty.
<i>Franck</i><a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c011'><sup>[310]</sup></a> also states an instance in which so considerable
a portion of the penis had been carried away
by a musket shot, that when the wound healed, the
organ remained curved, and yet it proved adequate
to the performance of its functions.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Paralysis affecting the muscles of the penis is
not a disease of very rare occurrence; it may depend
upon various injuries of the nervous system, and
while it remains, it is unnecessary to say that the penis
is incapable of performing those sexual functions for
which it is constructed, constituting the <i>Anaphrodisia
Paralytica</i> of Dr. <i>Cullen</i>. The continued erection
of the penis (<i>priapism</i>) is sometimes the result of
morbid irritation,<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c011'><sup>[311]</sup></a> and occasions a temporary impotence,
(the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dyspermatismus Hypertonicus</span></i> of <i>Cullen</i>)
in consequence of the urethra being so closely
shut up by the vigour of the erection, that the powers
which throw the semen from the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vesiculæ seminales</span></i>
are unable to overcome it; gentle evacuations and a
slender diet are the best remedies in such a case.
Strictures in the urethra, or morbid affections of the
prostate glands, may occasion a similar inconvenience,
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dyspermatismus Urethralis</span></i>) and we perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>ought to enumerate extreme costiveness under the
same division of the subject.</p>

<h6 class='c012'>IN FEMALES.</h6>

<p class='c013'>Adhesion of the Labia may take place in adult women
from inflammation; in consequence of which the
due secretion of mucus with which these parts are naturally
clothed on their internal surface is prevented;
or it may arise from the neglect of accidental excoriation.
In children the labia frequently cohere in
such a manner as to leave no vestige of a passage into
the vagina, except at the anterior part for the discharge
of urine; the disease, whenever it may occur,
is easily and safely removed by the knife.<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c011'><sup>[312]</sup></a> In some
cases hard labour has given rise to preternatural
union of the labia.<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c011'><sup>[313]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In cases of ulceration, where due care has not been
taken to prevent the surfaces from remaining in contact
with each other, the opposite sides have adhered
so as to obliterate the passage; Schirrous and steatomatous
tumours,<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c011'><sup>[314]</sup></a> and polypi may also occupy the
cavity of the vagina: in certain cases these may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>removed with safety,<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c011'><sup>[315]</sup></a> in others some hazard<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c011'><sup>[316]</sup></a>
will attend the operation. There is sometimes a
faulty organization of the vagina itself, it may be too
short, and too narrow,<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c011'><sup>[317]</sup></a> (<i>Arctitudo</i>.) Inversion or
Prolapsus is perhaps one of its most common diseases;<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c011'><sup>[318]</sup></a>
in some rare instances the passage has been
obliterated by the <i>Clitoris</i>, elongated and enlarged in
such a manner as to equal the size of the penis, when
it constitutes one of those many peculiarities which
have been mistaken for an Hermaphrodite.</p>

<p class='c000'>The membrane called the <i>Hymen</i> has been found
of so strong and ligamentous a texture, that it cannot
be ruptured, and consequently prevents venereal congress.
Ambrose <i>Paré</i> relates the case of a young woman,
whose hymen was as strong as parchment, which
he was obliged to cut with the scissars, before coition
could be effected; a more recent case is recorded in
which the density of the membrane was so considerable
as to require the application of a trocar.<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c011'><sup>[319]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the incompatible locality of the vagina,
a malformation which occasionally occurs, it is
only necessary to allude;<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c011'><sup>[320]</sup></a> the medical judgment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>upon it must be directed by the circumstances of each
particular case.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where irritability of the sexual organs exists to
such a degree as to occasion insufferable pain at
the moment of coition, it must be regarded as a
source of impotence.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c011'><sup>[321]</sup></a> It may depend upon various
causes; Dr. <i>Cockburn</i><a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c011'><sup>[322]</sup></a> relates a case of this kind
which depended upon internal piles, and which was
cured by their removal. Mr. Anthony <i>White</i><a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c011'><sup>[323]</sup></a> has
published three very interesting cases, in which the
pain which accompanied the attempt at coitus was so
acute, that the women rarely escaped fainting; upon
examination he discovered in each of them a small fistulous
opening, leading into a sinus of at least two
inches and a half in length; the disease was attributed
in each instance to a local injury having some years
previously occasioned an abscess in those parts; the
painful state of the vagina was entirely and permanently
cured by dividing the sinus.</p>

<h5 class='c012'>2. <i>Functional Causes of Impotence.</i></h5>

<p class='c013'>Repeated intoxication, and vicious indulgences,
may so debilitate the constitution in general, and the
organs of generation in particular, as to render the
debauchee wholly incapable of venereal congress;
such impotence however is not to be regarded as permanent;
bark, steel, the cold-bath, and above all,
a change of habits may restore the patient to the full
possession of his powers. There is a peculiar species
arising from debility which deserves some notice in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>this place; it depends upon a want of consent between
the immediate and secondary organs of generation;
thus the penis acts without the testicles, and
becomes erected when there is no semen to be evacuated;
while the testicles secrete too quickly, and
an evacuation takes place without any erection of the
penis. Under the consideration of constitutional
causes, we must not omit to enumerate the occurrence
of Epilepsy: there can be little doubt, but that
in certain cases, the venereal orgasm has excited an
attack of this disease, and prevented the consummation
of the act; we are therefore bound to recognise it as
an occasional cause of impotence, and Dr. <i>Cullen</i> has
accordingly considered it as forming a distinct species,
under the title of <span class='sc'>Dyspermatismus</span> <i>Epilepticus</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The operation of certain powerful narcotics may
be likewise regarded as capable of producing impotence,
and cases are recorded where impotence, so
occasioned, has become permanent;<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c011'><sup>[324]</sup></a> much credulity,
however, has existed upon this subject; the
anaphrodisiac powers of Camphor were long believed,
and is one of the vulgar errors noticed by Sir Thomas
<i>Brown</i>;<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c011'><sup>[325]</sup></a> and Amurath the IVth published an
edict which made smoking tobacco a capital offence:
a measure which was founded on an opinion that it
rendered the people infertile;<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c011'><sup>[326]</sup></a> equally gratuitous
are the different opinions which have been advanced
respecting the aphrodisiac virtues of particular substances;
one of which, from the extent to which it is
believed, and the authority by which it is countenanced,
deserves to be noticed on this occasion; we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>allude to the popular notion that a fish diet contributes
to increase fecundity; and we are not a little
surprised to see it sanctioned by such a writer as
<i>Montesquieu</i>, who observes, that “the regimen of
certain monks seems to be wholly repugnant to the
intention of their founders.” The same belief is very
generally entertained in fishing towns, in consequence
of the great population of such places, but surely the
fact admits of easy explanation upon that general
principle in political economy, which no one will attempt
to deny, that the number of marriages will be
in proportion to the facility with which children can
be supported.</p>

<p class='c000'>A blow on the head may also deprive a man of his
virility; a case of this kind is related by <i>Hennen</i>, in
his Military Surgery, where a soldier became so affected
in consequence of a fracture of the occipital
bone, by the fragment of a shell.</p>

<h5 class='c012'>3. <i>Moral Causes of Impotence.</i></h5>

<p class='c013'>A temporary impotence from certain emotions of
the mind is by no means so rare an occurrence as may
be supposed; and in times of superstition was generally
attributed to the influence of some magical incantation;
an opinion which was even maintained by
<i>Zacchias</i>, <i>Teichmeyer</i>, and <i>Schurigio</i>, but which it is
hardly necessary to add, has been reprobated by <i>Vogel</i>,
<i>Cullen</i>, and all modern authorities. Where this
occurs it is often productive of the greatest distress of
mind, and has not unfrequently led the unfortunate
sufferer to the commission of suicide. Mr. <i>Hunter</i><a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c011'><sup>[327]</sup></a>
has treated this subject with his accustomed sagacity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and relates a successful mode of treatment; he prevailed
on a person in this situation to promise on his
honour to pass six nights in bed with a young woman
without attempting to have any connection with her,
whatever might be his power or inclination; he afterwards
assured <i>Mr. Hunter</i> that his resolution had
produced such a total alteration in the state of his
mind, that the power of connection soon recurred,
for instead of going to bed with the fear of inability,
he went with fears that he should be possessed with
so much desire, and so much power, as to become
uneasy to him, which really happened; and having
once broken the spell, his mind and powers went on
together, and they never relapsed into their former
state of imbecillity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Disgust is also a frequent cause of temporary impotence
“Morositas, Contemptus, Iræ, Tristitia, Corporis
immundities ac fætor, venerem primario supprimunt.”<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c011'><sup>[328]</sup></a>
The imagination<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c011'><sup>[329]</sup></a> is sometimes the
cause of temporary impotence, with regard to particular
females, as exemplified in the famous case of
the <i>Earl of Essex</i> and <i>Lady Frances Howard</i>, in
1613, in which the marriage was declared void, because
the Earl, on his own confession, was impotent
with regard to his lady, (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">erga hanc</span></i>) although he had
no defect or impediment, and was able to copulate
with other women.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have thus related the principal causes of Impotence
in the sexes; it would be as idle to dwell upon
the absurdity of the opinions which attach any weight
to astral influence, as it would to refute the idea,
that suggested the custom so universally observed by
the Scythians, and which is even followed at this day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>by the natives of some of the South sea islands, of
cutting the veins behind the ears, in order to render
the males impotent, and the females sterile.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>2. <i>STERILITY.</i></h4>

<p class='c013'>Sterility occurs more frequently in the female, than
impotence does in the male sex.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its causes may be distinguished into those that arise
from imperfect structure, and into those that entirely
depend upon a morbid performance of certain functions.</p>

<h5 class='c012'>1. <i>Organic Causes.</i></h5>

<p class='c013'><i>Absence of the uterus.</i> We have before alluded to
this occasional defect; it has sometimes occurred,
where the vagina has been wholly impervious.<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c011'><sup>[330]</sup></a>
<i>Columbus</i> dissected a woman who had always complained
of great pain <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in coitu</span></i>, in whom he found the
vagina very short, and no uterus at its termination.
In <i>Hufeland’s</i> German Journal<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c011'><sup>[331]</sup></a> for May 1819, a
case is related of a total deficiency of the uterus,
which was discovered by Professor <i>Stein</i> during an
operation undertaken to remedy a supposed contraction;
in this paper the author quotes several analogous
cases from the writings of <i>Engel</i>, <i>Schmuker</i>, and
<i>Theden</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Imperforated uterus.</i> The os uteri, says Dr. Baillie,
has been found to be so contracted as to have its passage
in a great measure obliterated; and it has even
been known to be closed up by the growth of an adventitious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>membrane. The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">os tincæ</span></i> may be also shut
up, either originally, or by cicatrix, in consequence
of suppuration, laceration, ulceration, or the like,
when the case may be considered as incurable, unless
the menstrual discharge force a passage by its pressure,
or the introduction of a trochar is able to afford
an opening<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c011'><sup>[332]</sup></a>. Original conformations of this kind
seldom admit of any cure, for besides the impervious
state of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">os tincæ</span></i> it not unfrequently occurs that
the uterus itself appears as a solid body, without any
cavity in its centre.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c011'><sup>[333]</sup></a> <i>Morgagni</i> states that he was
consulted by a barren woman, whose vagina was only
a third part of the usual length, and that its termination
felt firm and fleshy, in which case he advised a
dissolution of the marriage. <i>Marchetti</i>, on the contrary,
has given a case where the vagina ran downwards
beyond the internal orifice of the uterus, and
terminated in a kind of cul de sac.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Polypus in utero.</i> This may be sometimes removed
by exsection; a valuable paper upon this subject by
<i>M. Deguise</i> is to be found in the <cite>Nouveau Journal de
Medicine</cite>, entitled “Observations des Polypes Uterines,”
in which the author relates many successful
cases, and controverts the common opinion, that after
the operation for an uterine polypus, the organ is
incapable of being impregnated.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Ovaria, absence of, or diseased condition of.</i> There
is a specimen in Dr. Hunter’s museum, in which one
ovarium is wanting; other instances have been recorded
in which no vestige of an ovarium could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>observed on either side.<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c011'><sup>[334]</sup></a>. The case of this kind
published by Mr. <i>Pears</i> in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1805, we have before described: to this
may be added another instance from the writings of
<i>Morgagni</i>. Instances of diseased ovaria are very
common, and may arise from a variety of causes: the
<i>Fallopian tubes</i> may also, in consequence of peritoneal
inflammation, become obliterated, and lose the power
of conveying the ovum from the ovarium to the uterus;
they may besides be originally defective in structure;
Dr. <i>Baillie</i> has seen them, without any aperture, or
<i>fimbriated</i> extremity, terminate in a cul-de-sac. <i>Morgagni</i>
noticed these tubes in some courtesans having
been entirely obliterated by the thickening of their
parietes; an evident consequence of the habitual orgasm
in which they had been kept by too frequent
excitement. <i>Richerand</i> on dissecting a subject at
La Charité that had been sterile, found the fringed
margins, or expanded extremities of the tubes, adhering
to the lateral and superior parts of the pelvis,
so that it had been impossible for them to perform
the motions necessary for fecundation.</p>

<h5 class='c012'>2. <i>Functional Causes.</i></h5>

<p class='c013'>These are constitutional debility, leucorrhœa, or
an excess, or deficiency of the menstrual discharge.
Observation has fully established the fact, that women
who do not menstruate cannot conceive; this discharge
appears to be essentially necessary for the due
and healthy state of the uterus, and Dr. <i>Denman</i><a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c011'><sup>[335]</sup></a>
has also observed that in cases of painful menstruation,
a membranous substance is often discharged, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>that no woman, in the habit of forming such a membrane
has been known to conceive, although, he adds,
that as it is not uninterruptedly formed at each period
of menstruation, the capability of conceiving may exist
at any interval of freedom from its formation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Women who are very corpulent are often barren,
for their corpulence either exists as a mark of weakness
of the system, or it depends upon a want of activity
in the ovaria; thus spayed, or castrated animals
generally become fat.</p>

<p class='c000'>A state of exhaustion of the uterine system, occasioned
by frequent and promiscuous intercourse with
the other sex, is also a very common cause of barrenness
in women, and hence few prostitutes conceive.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some cases the uterine system is capable of being
acted on by the semen of one individual, but not by
that of another, for many instances are on record
where persons have lived in wedlock without offspring,
and being, after divorce, re-married, have
each had families.</p>

  <h3 class='c010'>3. OF THE LEGITIMACY OF CHILDREN.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The validity of Marriage considered on medical
grounds being established, the next point to be considered
in the same light is the legitimacy and illegitimacy
of children, as it may legally affect their rights
to succession and property<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c011'><sup>[336]</sup></a>. On this point the
laws of England are most indulgently favourable to
the child, for provided “it be born though not begotten
in lawful wedlock,” (1 <i>Bl. Com.</i> 454.) the law will
presume its legitimacy, (5 <i>Rep.</i> 98.) (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">præsumitur pro
legitimatione</span></i>). But this presumption may be rebutted
by evidence. “As if the husband be out of the kingdom
of England (or as the law somewhat loosely
phrases it, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">extra quatuor maria</span></i><a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c011'><sup>[337]</sup></a>) for above <em>nine</em>
months, so that no access to his wife can be presumed,
her issue during that period shall be bastards.”
(1 <i>Bl. Com.</i> 454. 457. <i>Co. Litt.</i> 244.) but it was held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>that if the husband was in England during any part
of the time between the conception and the birth
(without any reference to the physiological impossibility
of the fact) the child would be deemed legitimate
(<i>Rex v. Alberton.</i> 1 <i>Raym.</i> 395.) If the husband
be proved castrate the issue are bastards (1 <i>Ba.
Ab.</i> 310. <i>Rolle Ab. tit. Bastard</i>, 356.) But though
the husband were divorced from his first wife <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">causa
frigiditatis</span></i>, yet his issue by his second were adjudged
legitimate, (5 <i>Rep.</i> 98.) and this is reasonable, for
there may be an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">impotentia erga hanc</span></i>, from various
causes; (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide post.</span></i>) If a man marries a woman who
is pregnant, he is generally to be supposed cognisant
of the fact, and that he is the father of the child; and
the law which regards the time of birth, and not of
conception, pronounces it legitimate. But the husband
may have been imposed upon, and utterly ignorant<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c011'><sup>[338]</sup></a>
of his wife’s state. A man returning from
abroad (to put the case of non access more strongly)
marries immediately on his arrival; within four or
five months his wife is delivered of a perfect child
which lives, shall such child inherit? on the one hand
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Præsumitur pro patre quem nuptiæ demonstrant</span></i>, on the
other, the ordinary course of nature prohibits the supposition
that the child can be the offspring of the husband.
But see <i>Rolle Ab. tit. Bastard</i>, p. 358, where
the woman was <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grossement enseint</span></i> the issue was held
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un mulier</span></i>, and contrary decisions cited there: see also
<i>Foxcroft’s Case, Rolle</i>, 359, &amp; <i>sec.</i> 45. So also a man
may purposely marry a pregnant woman to disappoint
his supposed heir at law; on the other hand a woman
may for some purpose of malignity bastardize her offspring,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>as was the case of <i>Savage</i> the poet.<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c011'><sup>[339]</sup></a>. But
none can be legitimate who are born out of wedlock;
in which our law differs materially from the Roman
or Canon law, and it is somewhat singular that the
celebrated<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c011'><sup>[340]</sup></a> “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quod nolunt Leges Angliæ mutare</span></i>” of
the Barons, at the Parliament of Merton, in the 20th
of <i>Henry</i> the 3d, should have been induced by an attempt
on the part of the bishops, (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnes episcopi magnates</span></i>)
to introduce this novelty,—that children born
before marriage should be legitimised by the subsequent
performance of the ceremony between their
reputed parents. There may indeed be a few instances
where illegitimate children have been legitimised by
Act of Parliament<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c011'><sup>[341]</sup></a>, but though such legislative
interference might in some cases of extreme doubt
and hardship be deemed not only excusable, but desirable,
the present feeling appears to be so strong
against such Acts, that the rule of Law may be considered
as among the most fixed; yet there are some
points which may yet receive considerable elucidation
from the studies of the physiologist, and these will
resolve themselves into several questions, (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vide post.</span></i>)</p>

<p class='c000'>For the legal authorities on this subject we cannot
do better than refer the reader to the very learned
note of Mr. <i>Hargrave</i> in his valuable edition of <i>Coke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Littleton</i>, and to the same subject in his <cite>Jurisconsult
Exercitations</cite>, vol. 3. p. 411; but as these may not
be of easy access to our medical readers we have
added a full extract of them in the <i>Appendix</i>, p. 209.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>SUPPOSITITIOUS CHILDREN.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>But there is yet another question which may, and
in truth frequently does occur; where either a pretended
pregnancy is followed by the grosser fraud of
imposing a strange child upon the husband, either for
the purpose of fixing his affection, or securing his
estate; or where a living and healthy child is substituted
for one either dead, or too sickly to give reasonable
hope of prolonged existence. To this crime our
laws assign no specific punishment; the parties can
only be indicted for a conspiracy as they might have
been for any ordinary misdemeanor; the real punishment
falls on the unconscious instrument of the
wrong,<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c011'><sup>[342]</sup></a> the child, who having been educated
in every indulgence that affection and affluence could
bestow, finds itself on the exposure of a vindictive
menial, without name, hope, or fortune; abandoned
by its assumed, it may be unable to trace its real parents,
yet the authors of this irreparable wrong have
generally escaped even the inadequate punishment
to which their crime had subjected them. Those who
are curious to inform themselves of the doubts and
difficulties with which such questions are entangled,
will do well to consult the proceedings in the celebrated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Douglas case,<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c011'><sup>[343]</sup></a> than which few have ever
excited so much difference of opinion on the bench,
or so much intensity of interest in the public mind.
The Anglesea case also, with the several trials connected
with it,<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c011'><sup>[344]</sup></a> is well worthy of perusal by those
whom interest or curiosity may lead to this species of
investigation.</p>

<p class='c000'>We should not have alluded to personal resemblance<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c011'><sup>[345]</sup></a>
between parents and children, as a mode
of proof in these cases, first, as we have doubted whether
such proof can be satisfactory, and secondly, as
it may not be considered a point of medical evidence;
but as to our first doubt, we find that so high an authority
as Lord <i>Mansfield</i> thought that a family likeness
was a material proof that a child was the genuine
offspring of the parents through whom he claimed.
His lordship in delivering his judgment in the House
of Lords on the Douglas cause, is reported to have
said, “I have always considered likeness as an argument
of a child’s being the son of a parent; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>the rather, as the distinction between individuals
in the human species is more discernible than other
animals<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c011'><sup>[346]</sup></a>: a man may survey ten thousand people
before he sees two faces perfectly alike; and in an
army of a hundred thousand men every one may be
known from another. If there should be a likeness
of feature, there may be a discriminancy of voice, a
difference in the gesture, the smile, and various other
characters; whereas a family likeness runs generally
through all these, for in every thing there is a resemblance,
as of features, size, attitude, and action. And
here it is a question, whether the appellant most resembled
his father Sir <i>John</i>, or the younger <i>Sholto</i>
resembled his mother Lady <i>Jane</i>? Many witnesses
have sworn to Mr. <i>Douglas</i> being of the same form
and make of body as his father; he has been known
to be the son of Colonel <i>Stewart</i>, by persons who
had never seen him before; and is so like his elder
brother, the present Sir <i>John Stewart</i>, that except
by their age, it would be hard to distinguish the
one from the other.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If Sir <i>John Stewart</i>, the most artless of mankind,
was actor in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enlevement</span></i> of <i>Mignon</i> and <i>Saury’s</i>
children, he did in a few days what the acutest
genius could not accomplish for years; he found
two children, the one the finished model of himself,
and the other the exact picture in miniature of Lady
<i>Jane</i><a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c011'><sup>[347]</sup></a>. It seems nature had implanted in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>children what is not in the parents; for it appears
in proof that in size, complexion, stature, attitude,
colour of the hair, and eyes, nay in every other
thing, <i>Mignon</i> and his wife, and <i>Saury</i> and his
spouse were, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toto cœlo</span></i>, different from and unlike to
Sir <i>John Stewart</i> and Lady <i>Jane Douglas</i>.” 2 <i>Collec.
Jurid. p.</i> 402.</p>

<p class='c000'>A painter or a sculptor would be more competent
to decide a question of this nature than a physician
or surgeon, but in their absence there is none on
whose testimony we can more safely rely than on
the medical witness, whose habits of observing the
formation, changes, and peculiarities of the human
body, naturally prepare him for such examination.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been supposed that an experienced surgeon
or midwife might be able to determine whether a
newly born infant was the child of a particular woman,
both being submitted to their examination;
but this mode of proof, fallacious as it must always
be, can be of no possible value, unless the investigation
take place within a very few days of the supposed
delivery; and even then it goes no further than to
determine that the birth and delivery have been nearly
cotemporaneous, a result not inconsistent with the
supposition that the infant is the child of some other
woman, and substituted for one dead, unhealthy, or
of the sex incapable of succession.</p>

<p class='c000'>In ordinary cases this early inspection is not likely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>to take place, as in the lifetime of both parents the
heir presumptive seldom has a summons to view proceedings;
but in the case of a pregnant widow, and
especially where there has been a question <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de ventre
inspiciendo</span></i>, it is otherwise, and it then becomes a
point of duty in all parties, to obtain the most satisfactory
evidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>A yet more important occasion occurs at the birth of
princes; whose entrances and exits are equally subject
to question, whenever a disputed succession or
an impatient heir give rise to speculation. In England
and elsewhere precautions are taken which are
as offensive to female delicacy as they are ineffective
to the demonstration of truth. The chamber of a
pregnant princess, at the moment when quiet is most
necessary, is crowded with officers of state and lords
of the household; yet we need not remind the reader
of all the questions which have, however foolishly,
been raised on the supposititious births of princes; for
the evidence on the birth of Prince <i>Charles Edward</i>,
see 12 <i>Howel. St. Tri.</i> 123. We need only observe that
imposition is best practised by skilful jugglers in a
crowd, and without disrespect to those learned and
reverend personages, we may doubt whether the
<a id='arch'></a>Archbishop of Canterbury, or the Lord High Chancellor,
can be as effective at an <i>Accouchement</i>, as the
President of the College of Physicians, or the Master
of the College of Surgeons.</p>

<p class='c005'>Whether a child, born under certain circumstances,

considered here, though the external signs of incipient

present, who may at a future period be called to
corroborate their testimony. We have known an

  <h2 class='c008'><span class='sc'>Of Monsters and Hermaphrodites, legally considered.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It will be seen by the note from <i>Co Litt</i>, quoted
under the preceding head, that by the law of England
a monster cannot inherit; but the question as to
what constitutes a monster is left vague and undetermined.
It can seldom have been necessary to agitate
this point, since few well attested instances are recorded
of any monster, which has materially deviated
from the human form,<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c011'><sup>[356]</sup></a> having long survived its
birth. Some curious instances, however, have occurred
of twins who, having become united in the
womb by an obvious operation of nature,<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c011'><sup>[357]</sup></a> have
lived for several years.<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c011'><sup>[358]</sup></a> Whether each body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>should possess separate legal rights would probably
be determined by the question whether each possessed
the vital organs necessary for a separate existence,
if, bating the danger of the operation, they could be
corporeally severed. Is it necessary to inform the
midwife that he is not authorised to destroy any production
however monstrous!<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c011'><sup>[359]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The case of Hermaphrodites, or rather of those
who may have been deemed such, stands on different
grounds; in the physiological illustrations of this
subject, the circumstances will be investigated which
have led to erroneous conclusions upon this point.
In a legal view, it is only necessary to caution the
medical attendants to be more careful in the investigation
of such cases of doubt, especially where succession
to property may depend on the sex of the
child. The case of the celebrated <i>Chevalier D’Eon</i>,
may long serve as a warning to those who would

  <h2 class='c008'>PHYSIOLOGICAL ILLUSTRATIONS CONNECTED WITH THE FOREGOING SUBJECTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The investigation of the preceding subjects necessarily
comprehends within its range a series of physiological
questions of great importance, the solution
of which is essential to the establishment of just and
satisfactory conclusions; we therefore now proceed to
the consideration of <em>Conception</em>: a subject which in
relation to Legitimacy, and the various legal questions
dependant on it, may be considered as the basis
upon which the superstructure rests, or the trunk
from which the various ramifications of inquiry must
proceed.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Of Conception and Utero-Gestation.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>The different theories which the ingenuity of the
physiologist has invented for the elucidation of this
mysterious and wonderful process, have been supported
with so much zeal and argument by the disciples
of one school, and disputed with so much warmth
and plausibility by those of another,<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c011'><sup>[362]</sup></a> that to recite
the merits and defects of each system would be a task
as laborious in its execution, as it must be unsatisfactory
and unprofitable in its results; we shall
therefore not attempt to ascend into the scale of
causes, but rest on the phenomenon of conception,
as an ultimate fact, and confine our researches to the
history of its œconomy. The series of changes which
constitute the phenomena of conception and gestation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>are clearly proved by the experiments of <i>De
Graaf</i> to originate in the ovaries, and not in the uterus,
as former physiologists had supposed. One or
more of the vesicles, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ova</span></i>, contained in the former
of these organs, no sooner receive the vivifying impression
communicated by the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">coitus</span></i> than they are
loosened from their connection, and grasped by the
fimbriæ of the Fallopian tube, by whose peristaltic
contractions they are, in due time, conveyed into the
uterus; the spot in the ovarium from which the ovum
has been thus separated, when examined after death,
exhibits a slightly lacerated appearance, as if the
germ had been detached from a vesicle at the moment
of conception, by the rupture of its parietes; to this
structure, which from the colour that it assumes
has been called by physiologists <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus luteum</span></i>, we
shall have frequent occasion to allude during the
course of the present inquiry. While these actions
are proceeding, the uterus passes through several
contemporary changes, in order to prepare it for the
reception of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ovum</span></i>; its blood-vessels are increased
in size, as seen in slight cases of inflammation; the
texture of its internal surface becomes softer, and
more spongy, and a white mucus is secreted, which,
from the extreme delicacy of its arrangement, has
been compared by <i>Harvey</i><a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c011'><sup>[363]</sup></a> to the web of the spider;
it soon, however, assumes a more solid form,
becomes vascular, and adheres so as to form a lining
to the whole cavity of the uterus, except at the orifices
which lead to the Fallopian tubes, and the os
uteri. <i>Dr. William Hunter</i> considered it as the inner
lamina of the uterus cast off, like the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">exuviæ</span></i> of some
animals, after every conception, and he accordingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>called it the <i>Decidua</i>, and from the manner of its
passing over the ovum, the Decidua <i>Reflexa</i>.<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c011'><sup>[364]</sup></a> It
is not known what exact interval is required for the
fœtal primordia to pass through the Fallopian tube,
and descend into the cavity of the uterus. <i>Valisnieri</i>
and <i>Haller</i> have never been able to find it distinctly
in the latter viscus before the seventeenth day. As
the mouth of the pregnant uterus is sealed up with
gelatinous matter from the moment of conception, it
is, under ordinary circumstances, incapable of allowing
any passage for the Catamenia, although exceptions
to this law are frequently mentioned by men of
science,<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c011'><sup>[365]</sup></a> which have probably arisen from the observation
of an occasional sanguineous discharge from
the vessels of the vagina; and which, says <i>Burns</i>,<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c011'><sup>[366]</sup></a>
are neither regular as to the monthly period, nor of
the same quality as that of the menses, and he concludes
by remarking, that he has never known any
instance where menstruation was perfect and regular
during the whole of pregnancy. <i>Dr. Denman</i><a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c011'><sup>[367]</sup></a>,
whose authority upon such a question must carry
with it very considerable weight, says, “a suppression
of the <i>Menses</i> is one of the never-failing consequences
of conception, at least I have not met with a
single instance to the contrary.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Conception is succeeded by many important
changes in the constitution, that are indicated by affections
of various parts, and which, therefore, to a
certain degree, afford <em>signs</em> of a woman having conceived;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>and indeed in the earlier periods of pregnancy,
they afford us the only means of judging of
the fact; and although they are necessarily ambiguous
and uncertain, yet <i>Dr. Denman</i> observes, that
from the common occurrence of the case, and the particular
attention which is paid to it, a faculty of discrimination
is acquired which generally prevents
error. The medical jurist, however, can never receive
such testimony as satisfactory, and it is fortunate that
the law rarely requires elucidation upon this point,
for in those cases of violent death in which it may be
important to ascertain the fact, the light of dissection
will assist our decision; and in cases where the plea
of pregnancy has been set up, in bar of punishment,
it will not avail, unless it be so far advanced as to
render our investigation easy and satisfactory. The
following symptoms may be said to afford the earliest
indications of pregnancy: the disappearance of the
catamenia; nauseating sickness, or vomiting, chiefly
occurring in the morning, and after meals, and which
in some cases is almost coeval with conception, and
often resembles sea-sickness, both in the violence of
its symptoms, and the obstinacy with which it resists
every measure of relief; vertigo and drowsiness;
heart-burn and diarrhæa, frequently supervene; the
appetite becomes depraved; there is a feverish diathesis;
the breasts swell, and the nipples are surrounded
by an areola, or brown circle, which is more
or less dark according to the complexion of the woman;
the countenance becomes altered, the eyes appearing
larger, and the mouth wider; and a peculiar
sharpness is given to every feature; the temper also
becomes unnaturally peevish, and the sleep is broken
and disturbed. Subsidence, or falling in of the abdomen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>is recorded by the old French proverb as another
sign of pregnancy,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Dans une ventre plat</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un enfant il y a.”</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In some instances, particular sympathies occur, and
hence tooth-ache has been considered as affording
some evidence upon such an occasion. Some midwives
have supposed that the appearance of blood drawn
from the veins would indicate the state of pregnancy;
the blood undoubtedly becomes sizy very shortly after
conception, and it differs from that of a person affected
with inflammation; “in the latter case,” says
<i>Burns</i>,<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c011'><sup>[368]</sup></a> “the surface of the crassamentum is dense,
firm, and of a buff colour, and more or less depressed
in the centre; but in pregnancy, the surface is not
depressed, the coagulum is of a softer texture, of a
yellow and more oily appearance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not, however, possible to determine positively,
from the inspection of the blood; for a pregnant woman
may labour under some local disease, which will
impart to it a truly inflammatory character, while, on
the other hand, it is possible for the suppression of
the menses, if accompanied with a febrile diathesis,
to give the crassamentum the same appearance which
it would present during pregnancy; and, in truth,
the same remark will apply to all those signs to
which we have before alluded; and even the swelling
of the breasts, upon which so much stress has
been laid, as a presumptive sign of pregnancy, cannot
be considered unexceptionable, for so great a
sympathy subsists between the mammæ and the uterine
system, that any disturbance of the latter is not
unfrequently attended with an enlargement of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>former: such an occurrence is by no means uncommon
in Amenorrhæa. <i>Belloc</i>,<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c011'><sup>[369]</sup></a> however, has made
an observation respecting them which merits our regard;
he says, that when a woman has a suppression
of the menstrual flux, with the other concomitant
signs of pregnancy, we may consider her situation as
yet doubtful, because these signs are common both
to pregnancy and amenorrhæa; but if about the
third month, while the suppression still continues,
she suddenly recovers her health, and the incidental
circumstances disappear, her appetite, plumpness,
and colour returning, nothing can better prove the
existence of pregnancy; for had the impaired health,
and the accompanying symptoms been the simple
effect of suppression, the derangement would have
continued, and even increased during the continuance
of the cause; to this observation, however, of <i>Belloc</i>,
we have one important objection to offer: in every case
of clandestine pregnancy, (and it is on such occasions
that our diagnosis is principally useful) the anxiety
and distress of the woman’s mind, and her desire to
appear as if labouring under some serious complaint,
will render her returning health at the period mentioned
by <i>Belloc</i> as unlikely, or very equivocal; in
short, we do but adopt the sentiments of the most experienced
midwives,<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c011'><sup>[370]</sup></a> when we assert, that it is
impossible to arrive at any conclusion beyond that of
suspicion; and in delivering a confident opinion upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>it, the practitioner must take care that he does not
compromise his character for skill and knowledge.
“Notandum est magna hic prudentia opus esse medico
ne facile graviditatem vel affirmet, vel neget;
peritissimi enim decepti fuerunt toties; nunquam magis
periclitatur fama medici, quam ubi agitur de graviditate
determinanda.”<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c011'><sup>[371]</sup></a> History informs us, says
<i>Capuron</i>,<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c011'><sup>[372]</sup></a> and it is attested by <i>Ambrose Paré</i>, <i>Moriceau</i>,
<i>Riolan</i>, <i>Devaux</i>, and others, that pregnant
women have been brought to the scaffold, after an
examination by medical men and matrons, who have
declared the absence of pregnancy.</p>

<p class='c000'>At about the <em>Fourth</em> month after conception, that
stage of utero-gestation arrives, which enables us,
by means of an external examination, to place the
fact beyond the reach of conjecture; for at this stage
the uterus may be distinctly felt through the integuments
of the abdomen; nor are we able before this
period to determine the question by any examination
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per vaginam</span></i>, for the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fundus</span></i> uteri is the portion first
distended in consequence of conception; while the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cervix</span></i>, the only part that we can feel, does not begin
to shorten to any appreciable extent, before the period
just stated.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c011'><sup>[373]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The following method of examining the uterus, in
order to ascertain whether it be gravid, is proposed
by <i>Tortosa</i>,<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c011'><sup>[374]</sup></a> and is well calculated to accomplish the
object. The woman, being fasting, and her bowels
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>and bladder having been previously evacuated,
should be directed to lie down, with the loins low,
and with the head and buttocks elevated; the knees
are then to be raised and bent, so as to bring the
thighs to the belly, and the heels to the buttocks, by
which position the abdominal integuments will be relaxed;
the midwife is then to place the hand upon
the epigastric region in such a manner that the little
finger may rest on the pubes, and the thumb on the
navel, and ordering the woman to breathe hard, he
must press the belly gently during the expiration: if
the uterus be gravid, and is more than three months
advanced, he will at this moment feel above the
pubes an equal, hard, globular body; and if the same
examination be made after the fifth month of gestation,
he will probably feel at the same time the motions
of the fœtus; but, in cases where no tumour
can be distinctly felt, the operator must be very careful
not to be deceived by motion, for the action of
flatus may mislead him, and even where an obvious
enlargement exists, the pulsations of the aorta may
lend to it a deceptive motion; this is particularly
striking where the ovarium is extensively diseased,
or the uterus is distended with tumours, an occurrence
which has not unfrequently induced the patient
to consider herself pregnant;<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c011'><sup>[375]</sup></a> in such a case the
ovarium may be felt through the parietes of the abdomen,
sometimes pretty high, like the uterus, or
like a prominent part of a child, but the round and
circumscribed nature of the tumour can never deceive
an experienced midwife. <i>Avenzoar</i>, however, has left
a confession that he was deceived about his own wife,
whom he had treated as dropsical, though she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>passed her fourth month of pregnancy.<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c011'><sup>[376]</sup></a> We ought
also to state that dropsy and utero-gestation may be
coexistent, and there are unfortunate cases on record
where, on such occasions, women have been sacrificed
by the mistaken application of the trocar.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to ascertain the exact state of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">os uteri</span></i>,
an examination must be made <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per vaginam</span></i>, which
may be conveniently effected while the woman remains
in the same position, by introducing the fore
and middle fingers of the right hand. For the first
three months the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">os tincæ</span></i> feels smooth and even, and
its orifice is nearly as small as in the virgin state;
when any difference can be perceived, it will consist
in the increased length of the projecting tubercle of
the uterus, and the shortening of the vagina from the
descent of the fundus uteri through the pelvis: this
change in the position of the uterus, by which the
projecting tubercle appears to be lengthened, and
the vagina proportionally shortened, chiefly happens
from the third to the fifth month. The following is
another mode of examination proposed by the anatomist
<i>Petit</i>,<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c011'><sup>[377]</sup></a> and sanctioned by <i>Puzoff</i>,<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c011'><sup>[378]</sup></a> and
which, with some slight and unimportant difference,
coincides with that recommended by <i>Morand</i><a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c011'><sup>[379]</sup></a> and
<i>Baudelocque</i>.<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c011'><sup>[380]</sup></a> The woman having been placed in
the position above described, two fingers are to be
introduced into the vagina, so far as to touch the orifice
of the uterus; and at the same time, the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>hand is to be applied to the abdomen; the operator
is then to press internally with his fingers, so as to
raise the uterus, and then lower it again by pressing
on the abdomen with the other hand; if by such alternate
movements a solid resistance is felt, without
fluctuation, we may be assured that the uterus is
gravid.</p>

<p class='c000'>As utero-gestation advances, the question of pregnancy
becomes, of course, less equivocal; for the
progressive increase of the abdominal tumour, from
the stretching of the fundus uteri, affords a mark too
decisive to be easily mistaken. About the <em>sixteenth</em> or
<em>eighteenth</em> week after conception, the uterus suddenly
ascends from the pelvis into the abdomen, a change
which is attended with a very peculiar sensation to
the woman, and is erroneously called <em>Quickening</em>,<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c011'><sup>[381]</sup></a>
from its having been supposed to arise from the first
motions of the fætus in utero, which was imagined at
this period to receive the essence of vitality; the law
of England still sanctions this hypothesis as a principle
by which the degree of criminality<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c011'><sup>[382]</sup></a> in cases of
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abortus procuratus</span></i> is determined, and according to
which the plea of pregnancy in bar of punishment is
either admitted or rejected.<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c011'><sup>[383]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>The physiologist is now satisfied that the sensation
has no relation either to the life, or to the motions
of the fætus, but is solely attributable to the <em>sudden</em>
change in the position of the uterus; nor is there
any difference between the aboriginal life of the child,
and that which it possesses at any period of pregnancy,
though there may be an alteration in the proofs of its
existence by the enlargement of its size, and the acquisition
of greater strength. The feeling of <em>Quickening</em>
is very different from any that is excited by
the subsequent motions of the child; it more nearly
resembles that which is occasioned by terror or agitation
from any other cause, and is often followed by
Syncope, or Hysteria; we shall indeed cease to be
surprised at this effect when we consider that from
the uterus thus changing its situation, a very considerable
pressure is suddenly removed from the Iliac
vessels, in consequence of which the blood rushes to
the lower extremities, and a temporary exhaustion
of the vessels of the brain, and a general loss of balance
in the circulating system, are the results. In
some women the motion is so obscure as not to occasion
any distress, and where the ascent of the uterus
is gradual, it is often not felt at all. In the <em>fifth</em>
month, the abdomen swells like a ball with the skin
tense; the fundus uteri now extends about half way
between the pubes and umbilicus, and the cervix is
sensibly shortened; in the <em>sixth</em>, the upper edge of
the fundus is a little below the umbilicus; and in
the <em>seventh</em> the fundus, or superior part of the uterine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>tumour, advances just above the umbilicus, and the
cervix is then nearly three-fourths distended; in the
<em>eighth</em> it reaches midway between the navel and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scrobiculus
cordis</span></i> itself, the neck being then entirely distended:
thus at full time the uterus occupies all the
umbilical and hypogastric regions, although a short
time before delivery it subsides to where it was between
the <em>seventh</em> and <em>eighth</em> month.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Of <span class='sc'>Parturition</span>, or <i>Delivery</i>.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The term of utero-gestation is limited by nature to
nine calendar months, or <em>forty weeks</em>, at the expiration
of which, the process of labour usually commences;
ingenious theorists have endeavoured to
discover the principle of the expulsatory action of the
uterus, and to assign the reason of its taking place at
a stated period, but after all the subtle ingenuity
which has been displayed upon this occasion, it is
doubtful whether we are prepared with a better solution
of the problem than that furnished by the physiologist
in the time of <i>Avicenna</i>, who declared that labour
came on at the appointed season, <em>by the command
of <span class='sc'>God</span></em>. We shall therefore pass over the
question without farther discussion, and proceed to
the investigation of those practical parts of the subject,
which are highly interesting on account of their
numerous and important relations to medical jurisprudence;
we propose, therefore, to discuss the following
questions in succession:</p>

<p class='c019'>1. Whether a woman can be delivered during a
state of insensibility, and remain unconscious of
the event?</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>2. How far the term of utero-gestation can be
shortened, to be compatible with the life of the
offspring?</p>
<p class='c019'>3. Whether to any, and to what probable or possible
extent, the natural term of utero-gestation
can be protracted?</p>
<p class='c019'>4. What is the value of those signs by which we
seek to establish the fact of a recent delivery?</p>
<p class='c019'>5. Are there any, and what diseases, whose effects
may be mistaken for the traces of a recent delivery?</p>
<p class='c019'>6. Can we determine by any signs, whether a woman
has ever borne a child, although at a period
remote from that of the examination?</p>
<p class='c019'>7. What are the earliest and latest periods of life
at which women are capable of child-bearing?</p>
<p class='c019'>8. What is the possible number of children that
may be produced at one birth?</p>
<p class='c019'>9. Is <i>Superfœtation</i> possible, and under what circumstances,
and at what period of gestation can
a second conception take place?</p>
<p class='c019'>10. What are the causes of <i>Abortion</i>?</p>
<p class='c019'>11. Under what circumstances, and by what means,
is it <em>morally</em>, <em>legally</em>, and <em>medically</em> proper, to
induce premature <em>labour</em>?</p>
<p class='c019'>12. What circumstances will justify the <em>Cæsarean
operation</em>, and of what value is the section of the
Symphysis Pubis, or <i>Sigaultian</i> operation?</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>
  <h4 class='c012'>Q. 1. <i>Whether a woman can be delivered during a state of insensibility, and remain unconscious of the event?</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In certain comatose states of the brain, as those
produced by depression of bone, the operation of
narcotic substances, or the violence of fever, we must
admit the possibility of such an occurrence; <i>Hippocrates</i><a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c011'><sup>[384]</sup></a>
relates the case of a woman who was delivered
during a state of insensibility, in the last stage
of fever, from which she never recovered, and therefore
died unconscious of the event. In the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Causes
Celèbres</span></i>,<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c011'><sup>[385]</sup></a> the case of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtesse de Saint Geran</span></i>
is recorded, who having been plunged into a profound
sleep, by a medicated draught prepared for that purpose,
brought forth a son without being in the least
conscious of the act that gave it birth; and when she
awoke, on the following day, bathed in her blood,
and exhausted in strength, and demanded her infant,
the artful attendants denied the fact of her delivery.
Women have moreover given birth to an offspring in
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">articulo mortis</span></i>; and many instances have occurred
where the infant has escaped from the womb during
the exertions of the mother to evacuate the contents
of the bowels.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>Q. 2. <i>How far the term of Utero-gestation can be shortened, to be compatible with the life (viabilité) of the offspring.</i></h4>

<p class='c013'>If this question could be decided by the number of
recorded cases, we should be called upon to acknowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>the possibility of the fœtus surviving at extremely
early periods; <i>Capuron</i><a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c011'><sup>[386]</sup></a> relates the case of
<i>Fortunio Liceti</i>, who, it is said, was born at the end
of four months and a half, and that he lived to complete
his twenty-fourth year! In the case of <i>Marechal
de Richelieu</i> the parliament of Paris decreed that
the infant at five months possessed that capability of
living to the ordinary period of human existence,<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c011'><sup>[387]</sup></a>
(<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">viabilité</span></i>) which the law of France required for establishing
its title of inheritance. The Roman law<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c011'><sup>[388]</sup></a>
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de suis et legitimis hœredibus</span></i>” establishes, upon the
authority of Hippocrates, that an infant may be born
<em>six months and two days</em> after the term of conception;
while a second law, sanctioned also by the same high
authority, requires an interval of <em>seven months</em> between
the conception and delivery; this discrepancy receives
explanation from the fact that the ancients fell into
many contradictions from indiscriminately using in
their calculations lunar and solar months; thus, for
instance, <i>Hippocrates</i> uses the former in his books
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Septimestri et Octomestri partu</span></i>,” while in those
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Alimento</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Carnibus</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Epidemicis</span></i>, the latter
uniformly constitute the basis of computation. Physiologists
of the present day consider that a fœtus born
before the completion of the seventh month has a very
slender chance of surviving, although instances have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>occurred where the life has been preserved after a
birth still more premature. <i>Hippocrates</i> and other
ancient physicians entertained a conceit, which has
even prevailed in the more modern schools of physic,
that an infant could live at <em>seven</em>, but rarely or never
at <em>eight</em> months; it is hardly necessary to observe
with <i>Haller</i>, that the capability of living in an infant
increases in the ratio of its maturity, or in proportion
as it advances towards the natural period of delivery;
the child, therefore, that is born at the expiration of
<em>eight</em> months has of necessity a greater aptitude for
living than the one which is produced at seven; and
nothing could have suggested or upheld a contrary
opinion but that overwhelming belief in the harmony
and powers of certain numbers with which the philosophers
of ancient days were infected, and of which
the Pythagorean number <span class='fss'>SEVEN</span> was deemed the most
perfect and efficient,<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c011'><sup>[389]</sup></a> as we have before had occasion
to remark, while treating of the subject of Ages.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>Q. 3. <i>Whether to any, and to what probable extent, the natural term of Utero-gestation can be protracted?</i></h4>

<p class='c013'>Although the period of gestation is usually limited
to nine calendar months, or <em>forty weeks</em>,<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c011'><sup>[390]</sup></a> yet the
term does not appear to be so arbitrarily established,
but that Nature may occasionally transgress her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>usual law; and, as we have just stated that many
circumstances may occur to anticipate delivery, so are
we bound to admit that in some instances it may be
retarded; in several tolerably well attested cases, the
birth appears to have been protracted several weeks
beyond the common time of delivery; and <i>Dr. Hamilton</i>
remarks upon this occasion, that if the character
of the woman be unexceptionable, a favourable
report should be given for the mother, though the
child should not be produced till nearly ten calendar
months after the absence or sudden death of her husband.
The question is one of the greatest importance
in its moral and legal relations, for it may involve
the honour and happiness of families, the legitimacy
of offspring, and the succession of property.<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c011'><sup>[391]</sup></a> We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>cannot, therefore, feel surprised that it should have
occupied so great a portion of the attention of our
most able physiologists, and have given origin to
considerable controversy. Each side is supported by an
equally respectable list of partisans, and we perceive
that upon this occasion the two celebrated medico-jurisconsults
of France are opposed to each other; <i>Mahon</i>
having associated his name with those of <i>Bohn</i>, <i>Hebenstreit</i>,
<i>Astruc</i>, <i>Mauriceau</i>, <i>Da La Motte</i>, <i>Rœderer</i>,
and <i>Baudelocque</i>, who reject the belief in <em>retarded
delivery</em> as impossible, and contrary to the immutable
law of nature; while the name of <i>Foderé</i>
ranges with those who support the contrary opinion,
as <i>Teichmeyer</i>, <i>Heister</i>, <i>Albert</i>, <i>Vallentini</i>, <i>Bartholin</i>,
<i>Haller</i>, <i>Antoine Petit</i>, <i>Lietaud</i>, <i>Vicq d’Azyr</i>,
and <i>Capuron</i>, who may boast of the support of
<i>Hippocrates</i>, <i>Aristotle</i>, and <i>Pliny</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Pliny</i> tells us that the Prætor <i>L. Papirius</i> was
declared entitled to succeed an infant born after
thirteen months, but he adds, this was <em>because</em> no time
appeared by law “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quoniam nullum certum tempus pariendi
statum videretur</span></i>.” We read in Aulus Gellius
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>of an edict by the Emperor Adrian in favour of a woman
of irreproachable character, who was delivered
eleven months after the decease of her husband; and
the parliament of Paris, in the case of a widow, decided
in favour of the legitimacy of an infant born in
the fourteenth month of pregnancy. <i>Bartholin</i> relates
the case of a young woman at Leipsic who was delivered
in the sixteenth month; and, if we may credit
it, the account would appear to have been as unexceptionable
as any case on record, for during her
pregnancy she was in custody by order of the magistrates.
The civil code of France has placed a limit
to our credulity respecting retarded births, and decrees
<em>three hundred</em> days, or ten months, to be the
most distant period at which the legitimacy of a birth
shall be allowed.<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c011'><sup>[392]</sup></a> Were we called upon to deliver
an opinion upon this momentous question, we should
certainly consider such a law as rather inclining on
the side of mercy, than on that of stern justice. For
any farther information upon this question, we must
refer the reader to the learned notes of Mr. <i>Hargrave</i>,
printed in our <i>Appendix, page</i> 209; but before
we quit the subject, we shall notice the opinion
of <i>Joubert</i>, if it be only for the purpose of animadverting
upon its absurdity; he supposes that the duration
of gravidity may be influenced by sexual indulgence;
supposing that excessive venery will accelerate, while
abstinence may so far retard the time of delivery, that
it shall not take place until after the expiration of
eleven months.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>
  <h4 class='c012'>Q. 4. <i>What is the value of those Signs by which we seek to establish the fact of a recent delivery?</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There are circumstances which may induce a woman
to conceal the event of parturition, or to simulate
a delivery which had never taken place; in either
of such cases the importance of medical testimony is
sufficiently obvious. In cases of alleged Infanticide
the practitioner is always required to examine the
supposed mother, and to give his opinion as to the
fact of her having been recently delivered: and his
report has not only very frequently acquitted the prisoner,
but in some cases has rescued the innocent but
unfortunate female from the horror and disgrace of a
public trial. <i>Capuron</i> cites a curious case which we
shall relate in this place as well adapted to exemplify
the serious importance of medical evidence on such
occasions:—A young woman having granted her favours
to a lover who had seduced her, under the promise
of wedlock, feigned pregnancy in the hope of
hastening the celebration of her marriage, but the
lover refused to ratify the solemn engagement into
which he had entered, and she therefore determined
to carry on the imposition, with a view to conciliate
his affections, and to secure his future protection and
support; for this purpose, after a proper interval had
elapsed, she confined herself for several days to her
bed-chamber, and having stained her linen and bed
with bullock’s blood, she openly declared that she
had been delivered, and that the infant had been
committed to the care of a nurse; the young man,
however, notwithstanding this supposed new pledge
of affection, remained obdurate, and persisted in his
refusal to complete his engagement; in consequence
of which all intercourse between the parties ceased,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>until after the lapse of two years, when the alleged
father claimed his child; in answer to this application
the young woman confessed the deception which she
had been induced to practise; but the criminal department
of the Seine, before whom she was summoned,
hesitated in giving credence to her tale; upon
which a personal inspection was instituted by <i>Capuron</i>,
<i>Maigrier</i>, and <i>Louyer Villermay</i>, in order to
decide whether the woman in question had ever been
delivered; and as the result of this inspection enabled
the professors to decide in the negative, the prisoner
was immediately discharged. A similar instance of
pretended delivery has recently appeared in a <cite>Berlin
Journal</cite>, as having occurred at Sirakovo in the circle
of Posen, where a young woman, anxious to fulfil
the ardent desire of her husband to have an heir,
pretended to have been suddenly and unexpectedly
delivered, and stole an infant in order to support the
fiction; the case was rendered more atrocious from
the real mother having, in consequence of the theft,
been subjected to the accusation of infanticide; the
fact was, however, happily discovered, and the culprit
has been delivered to the punishment due to her
crime. Such cases of pretended delivery are by no
means so rare as the reader may at first be led to
imagine; and the medical practitioner should be on
his guard lest he become the dupe of such an imposition.
<i>Dr. Male</i><a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c011'><sup>[393]</sup></a> relates a case which occurred not
long since in his own town; a surgeon was called to
a pretended labour, when a dead child was presented
to him, but there was no placenta; he therefore proceeded
immediately to examine the woman, when he
found the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">os tincæ</span></i> in its natural state, nearly closed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>and the vagina so much contracted as not to admit
the hand; astonished at this circumstance he went to
consult a medical friend; but before any farther steps
were taken, it was discovered that he had been imposed
upon; the woman, in fact, had never been
pregnant, and the dead child was the borrowed offspring
of another; it appears that she was induced to
practise the artifice to appease the wrath of her husband,
who frequently reproached her for her sterility.</p>

<p class='c000'>The signs from which the judgment of the midwife
is to be deduced may be comprised under the
following general and particular heads, to each of
which we shall successively direct our attention, and
endeavour to establish the degree of validity to which
they are singly or jointly entitled.</p>

<p class='c019'>1. The face is pale, the eye sunken, and surrounded
by a purplish or dark brown coloured
ring; the pulse is full and undulating;
the skin soft, supple, rather warmer
than ordinary, and covered with a moisture
which has a peculiar and somewhat acid
odour.</p>
<p class='c019'>2. The breasts are swelled, are harder than
usual, and painful; and, in some cases,
lumpy to the touch, and emit, by pressure
or suction, a lactiform fluid; the nipples
are thicker, and the areola, by which they
are surrounded, is widened in extent, and
darkened in colour.</p>
<p class='c019'>3. The abdomen is flaccid, and its skin lies in
folds, and is traversed in various directions
with shining, reddish, and whitish lines,
and light-coloured broken streaks, which
especially extend from the groins and the
pubes towards the navel.</p>
<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>4. There is an extraordinary swelling and
tumefaction of the external parts of generation;
sometimes the anterior margin of
the perineum is lacerated, or it is very lax,
from the distention which it has undergone.</p>
<p class='c019'>5. The vagina is preternaturally distended; the
orifice of the uterus is soft and open, and
capable of admitting the point of the finger
without difficulty, as if a late discharge had
been made from it; the womb itself, not
having properly collapsed, and resumed its
natural shape and dimensions, may be felt
through the parietes of the abdomen, voluminous,
firm, and globular, contracting
and expanding under the hand, on pressure.</p>
<p class='c019'>6. A discharge of serous fluid mingled with
blood from the vagina, called the <i>Lochia</i>,
continues from five to thirty-five days after
delivery: it differs from the common menstrual
flux in being paler, but more particularly
in its peculiar and characteristic
sour odour; at first this discharge is decidedly
sanious, but in a few days it becomes
of a much paler and of a brownish,
or a dirty green hue, so as to acquire the
common term of <em>green waters</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to these signs, <i>Michael Albertus</i> mentions
the hair falling off from the pubes as a sign of
delivery; it is hardly necessary to caution the practitioner
against relying upon any sign so extremely
uncertain and precarious.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the period during which the consecutive
signs of delivery remain evident, will vary in each
case, yet as a general position we must admit with
<i>Zacchias</i>,<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c011'><sup>[394]</sup></a> <i>Albert</i>, <i>Bohn</i>, <i>Foderé</i>, <i>Mahon</i>, and <i>Belloc</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>that after ten or twelve days, they may become
too obscure to afford unexceptionable evidence. This
conclusion was sanctioned by the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arrêt</span></i> of the parliament
of Paris, in the case of a woman of Mantes
accused of infanticide, who, in consequence of a conference
with <i>Antoine Petit</i> and <i>Louis</i><a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c011'><sup>[395]</sup></a> was pronounced
innocent, upon the ground of the woman
not having been examined as to the fact of her delivery,
until after the expiration of a month. The
criminal department of the Seine acquitted a woman
cook of the name of <i>Aimée Perdriat</i>, charged with
the perpetration of a similar crime, and of whose guilt
no reasonable doubt could be entertained, in consequence
of the same defect in the medical testimony.<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c011'><sup>[396]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The relative value which each of the signs possesses,
will be better appreciated after we have considered
the diseases whose effects may resemble them;
but as a general principle we are anxious to enforce
the necessity of always considering the consecutive
signs of parturition collectively, and not individually;
under such circumstances the practitioner can never
be betrayed into an erroneous conclusion; for, as
<i>Professor Chaussier</i> has remarked, “<em>no disease, or
affection, besides parturition, can possibly produce the
whole series of signs above described</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The secretion of milk, upon which such considerable
stress has been laid in ancient as well as in modern
times, it is now admitted may take place independently
of pregnancy, and we are accordingly bound to
reject the aphorism of Aristotle, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lac habet, ergo peperit</span></i>.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>In the <cite>Causes Celèbres</cite><a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c011'><sup>[397]</sup></a> there is an account
of a girl, who, although a virgin, suckled an infant;
and in the <i>Sloane</i> collection of manuscripts in the
British Museum, a case of a woman is related, who,
although she had not borne children for more than
twenty years, actually suckled her grand-children,
one after the other, at the age of 68! but, what is
still more extraordinary, instances have occurred
where men have been able to perform this duty. The
<span class='sc'>Bishop of Cork</span><a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c011'><sup>[398]</sup></a> has related a case in which a
man suckled his child after the loss of his wife; and
in the personal narrative of <i>Humboldt</i> we have an
analogous instance.<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c011'><sup>[399]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c012'>Q. 5. <i>Are there any, and what Diseases, whose effects may be mistaken for the traces of a recent delivery?</i></h4>

<p class='c013'>Dropsical discharges from the uterus, uterine hæmorrhage,
the expulsion of a mole, hydatid,<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c011'><sup>[400]</sup></a> or
polypus; or the removal of any of those diseases which
constitute what has been termed a <em>false conception</em>,
have been said to occasion effects which simulate the
signs of parturition. It must be admitted that there
are some signs which are common both to the diseases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>in question, and to the delivery, but there are at the
same time others that exclusively indicate the occurrence
of the latter; the irruption of fluids from the
womb, menorrhagia, and leucorrhæa, may mimic the
<i>lochial</i> discharge, but they will not remain, nor will
they present that characteristic odour by which the
latter is so preeminently distinguished; so again, the
relaxation of the soft parts may be the consequence
of disease as well as of delivery, while the paleness
of the visage is the usual concomitant of profuse evacuation;
but then the distention of the vagina, and
the state of the neck of the uterus, and the absence
of all contusions, lacerations, and discolourations
will obviate the possibility of deducing any erroneous
conclusion from these phenomena; the wrinkles and
marks upon the abdomen may certainly follow any considerable
change in the reduction of its bulk, whether
it be the result of parturition, ascitic discharges, or
the absorption of fat; but we may easily disarm such
signs of their treachery by a previous inquiry into the
state of the woman’s health, and into that of her robustness
and general strength. <i>Burns</i> also remarks
that other circumstances may concur in confirming
the opinion of the practitioner, “as for instance, if
the patient give an absurd account of the way in which
her bulk suddenly left her, ascribing it to a perspiration,
which never in a single night can carry off
the size of the abdomen in the end of a supposed
pregnancy.”<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c011'><sup>[401]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>
  <h4 class='c012'>Q. 6. <i>Can we determine by any signs whether a woman has ever borne a child, although at a period remote from that of the examination?</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The following are the principal indications of a
woman having been delivered at a distant period, but
in offering them to the attention of the practitioner,
it is necessary to observe, that <em>singly</em> they can furnish
but very slender evidence, and should they even all
occur, they must be regarded as affording only a
strong presumption of the fact.</p>

<p class='c019'>1. The orifice of the womb has not its conic figure;
its lips are unequal; and it is more
open than in those who have never borne
children.</p>
<p class='c019'>2. There is a roughness of the abdomen, the
parietes of which are also more expanded
and pensile.</p>
<p class='c019'>3. There are small white and shining lines running
on the surface of the abdomen.</p>
<p class='c019'>4. The breasts are more flaccid, and pendulous,
and the lines on their surface are white
and splendid.</p>
<p class='c019'>5. The nipples are prominent, and the colour
of their disks brown.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>Q. 7. <i>What are the earliest and latest periods of life, at which women are capable of child-bearing?</i></h4>

<p class='c013'><i>Zacchias</i> and other authors have considered the
commencement and cessation of menstruation as the
two extreme points, beyond which the female is incapable
of conception; they have very justly considered
the menstrual flux as indispensably necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>for the healthy action of the uterine system. It must
be also admitted that no female can conceive until
her system has undergone that revolution which we
have already described under the head of <i>Puberty</i>,
although we then stated, that the period of life at
which it takes place is liable to be controlled by several
physical as well as moral circumstances, we have
accordingly many instances upon record of very young
females having borne children: during the year 1816
some girls were admitted into the <i>Maternité</i> at Paris
as young as <em>thirteen years</em>; and during the revolution
one or two instances occurred of females at <em>eleven</em>,
and even below that age, being received in a pregnant
state into that hospital. <i>Schurigius</i><a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c011'><sup>[402]</sup></a> states the
case of a Flemish girl, who was delivered of a son at
the age of <em>nine</em> years; and in the notes to <i>Metzger</i> several
instances are related where conception had occurred
under the age of <em>ten</em>. It has been attempted
to ascertain what age, and what season was most prolific:
from an accurate register kept by <i>Dr. Bland</i>,
it would appear, that more women, between the age
of twenty-six and thirty years, bear children, than
at any other period; of 2102 women, who bore children,
85 were from fifteen to twenty years of age,
578 from twenty-one to twenty-five, 699 from twenty-six
to thirty, 407 from thirty-one to thirty-five, 291
from thirty-six to forty, 36 from forty-one to forty-five,
and 6 from forty-six to forty-nine.</p>

<p class='c000'>The time at which menstruation, and consequently
child-bearing ceases, will be materially influenced by
that at which it commenced; with those who commenced
at ten or twelve, the discharge often ceases
before the age of forty; but where the first appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>has been protracted to sixteen or eighteen, such
women may continue to menstruate until they have
passed the fiftieth year; but in this climate the most
usual period of cessation is between the age of forty-four
and fifty,<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c011'><sup>[403]</sup></a> after which women never bear children,
although we have in ancient<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c011'><sup>[404]</sup></a> as well as in modern
times, many extraordinary examples of protracted
fecundity, to which but little credit ought, in general,
to be attached. <i>Marsa</i>, a Venetian physician,
relates a case of a woman who at the age of sixty
brought forth a daughter, and suckled her, and whom
he had previously treated for what he had considered
to be ovarian dropsy; the annals of our own country<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c011'><sup>[405]</sup></a>
would furnish some extraordinary instances of
a similar kind. <i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i> illustrates the
subject by the case of the wife of a peruke-maker in
Poland-street, in the year 1775, who at the age of
fifty-four produced two sons and a daughter, although
she had been married for thirty years, and had never
before been pregnant.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is probable that many of those “well authenticated
instances” of old women having menstruated,
like those recorded of children, are merely sanguineous
discharges from the vagina, or from a diseased uterus;
this we have no doubt is the true explanation of the
case related by <i>Richerand</i>,<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c011'><sup>[406]</sup></a> of a woman, who at
the age of seventy had not ceased to menstruate.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>
  <h4 class='c012'>Q. 8. <i>What is the possible number of Children that can be produced at one birth?</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c013'>According to the most accurate estimates, <em>Twin</em>
cases, on an average, occur about once in ninety
labours; <em>Triplets</em> are considerably more rare, they
are stated not to take place more than once in three
thousand times; and the occurrence of four at a birth
is so rare an event, that no calculation has been
formed upon the subject. The reader will find a
very interesting paper on the “<cite>Plurality of Births</cite>,”
by <i>Dr. Garthshore</i>, in the 77th volume of the Philosophical
Transactions, to which we beg to refer him.
<i>Dr. Osborne</i> states that he has distinctly traced as
many as six fœtuses in an abortion.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a curious fact that the relative number of males
and females born is nearly equal, there being only a
small majority in favour of the former, in the proportion
of 21 to 20; in consequence of which both sexes
are equal at the age of 14, since more male children
are still-born, or die in infancy, than females, owing,
as <i>Dr. Clarke</i><a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c011'><sup>[407]</sup></a> has supposed, to the relative size
of the head, being greater in the former. <i>Hufeland</i><a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c011'><sup>[408]</sup></a>
has collected the relative number of the two sexes in
all parts of the world, and has found them every
where the same. “It seems very singular,” says Sir
<i>Gilbert Blane</i>,<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c011'><sup>[409]</sup></a> “and at the same time most admirable
in the institution of Nature, that this relative
number of the sexes should be maintained, though
the primordial germs are mixed in different proportions
in the ovaria of different females; for it is well
known that many women produce such a number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>children in succession, of the same sex, as is utterly
irreconcileable with the laws of blind chance, another
word for mathematical necessity.” The reader will
also derive much pleasure by the perusal of a memoir<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c011'><sup>[410]</sup></a>
upon this subject by <i>Dr. Arbuthnot</i>, entitled
“<cite>An Argument for Divine Providence, taken from
the constant regularity observed in the birth of both
Sexes</cite>” from which the learned author deduces as a
scholium, that polygamy is contrary to the law of
Nature and justice, and to the propagation of the
human species.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>Q. 9. <i>Is Super-fœtation possible, and under what circumstances, and at what period of Gestation can a second conception take place?</i></h4>

<p class='c013'>The term <i>Super-fœtation</i> implies that a second impregnation
may take place, whilst a child is in utero.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are perhaps few questions relating to the
subject of conception, that have given origin to more
rigorous controversy; and indeed its important judicial
bearings render it a subject of greater interest
than it could ever have become intrinsically as a mere
object of abstract speculation. Let us, for the sake
of illustration, suppose the following case:—A
woman loses her husband suddenly, <em>tenant in tail
male</em>, a month after marriage, and at a little more
than eight months after his decease she is delivered
of a perfect female child, and at nine months, she
declares that she is delivered of another infant, which
is a male. The heir at law, who has entered, contests
the fact of this latter birth; the question therefore
to be determined is, whether such an event is
compatible with the known laws of utero-gestation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ancient physicians and philosophers undoubtedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>believed in the possibility of super-fœtation; and
the Mythology contains a well characterised example
in the instance of Iphicles and Hercules, who were
begat upon Alcmæna, the former by Jupiter, and the
latter by Amphitryon. <i>Hippocrates</i>,<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c011'><sup>[411]</sup></a> <i>Aristotle</i>,<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c011'><sup>[412]</sup></a>
and <i>Pliny</i>,<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c011'><sup>[413]</sup></a> entertained no doubt respecting the
fact, and in later times we find that the most eminent
physiologists have sanctioned the same belief, and
have been engaged in recording facts in its support.
<i>Gasper Bauhuin</i><a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c011'><sup>[414]</sup></a> relates a case in which a woman
at the end of nine months brought forth a dead child,
with a deformed head, and that six weeks afterwards
she was delivered of a well formed child which
lived. <i>Buffon</i><a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c011'><sup>[415]</sup></a> presents us with a still more
striking example; a woman of Charles-town, in South
Carolina, was delivered in 1714 of twins, which came
into the world one directly after the other, but to the
great surprise of the midwife, one was black and the
other white; the woman herself, considering this
proof of her infidelity too obvious to be denied,
admitted the truth without hesitation,—that shortly
after having enjoyed the embraces of her husband, a
black servant entered her room, and by threats
accomplished his purpose. <i>Aristotle</i><a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c011'><sup>[416]</sup></a> speaks of an
adultress who produced at the same birth two sons,
the one of which resembled the husband, and the
other the lover; <i>Pliny</i><a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c011'><sup>[417]</sup></a> also relates several cases
of super-fœtation, some of which are certainly no
other than twin cases, and the others are merely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>copied from Aristotle. <i>Musa Brassavolus</i><a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c011'><sup>[418]</sup></a> has the
following remarkable observation upon the subject.
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nos vidimus super-fœtationem quandoque fuisse
epidemicam affectionem.</span></i>” <i>Zacchias</i><a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c011'><sup>[419]</sup></a> also believes
in the phenomenon; and in the case of one <i>Laurette
Polymnie</i>, his testimony secured for her child the
rights of inheritance; <i>Harvey</i><a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c011'><sup>[420]</sup></a> likewise relates a
case of super-fœtation, to which we beg to refer the
reader; <i>Haller</i><a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c011'><sup>[421]</sup></a> expresses his opinion in the following
words: “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Os uteri nunquam clausum est;
ideoque potest super-fœtari non solum a die sexto ad
trigessimum, aut primis duobus mensibus, sed omni
omnino tempore.</span></i>” <i>Zacchias</i><a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c011'><sup>[422]</sup></a> however, thinks that
it can only take place in the first two months of
pregnancy, for that after this period, the developement
of the fœtus renders it impossible. <i>Plouquet</i>
observes, that immediately after a first conception, a
second may easily take place, but that after a few
months it can only occur under the most extraordinary
circumstances. If time and space would allow
we might adduce a considerable mass of similar
testimony, but we shall conclude this part of the
subject with the opinion of <i>Kannegeiser</i>, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De super-fœtationis
existentia rationis quippe principiis, atque
infinitis hominum et brutorum exemplis abunde comprobatu,
Medicis atque jurisconsultis mens vix amplius
hæret in ambiguo.</span></i>”<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c011'><sup>[423]</sup></a> The best authenticated case
of super-fœtation that has occurred in our own times
is that communicated to the College of Physicians by
<i>Dr. Maton</i>:<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c011'><sup>[424]</sup></a> Mrs. T—— an Italian lady, remarkable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>for her fecundity, was delivered of a male child
at Palermo, on the 12th of November, 1807, under
very distressing circumstances, having been dropt on
a bundle of straw in an uninhabited room at midnight,
and although the infant at the time of his birth
had every appearance of health, he lived only nine
days; on February the 2d, 1808, (not quite three
calendar months from the preceding <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">accouchement</span></i>)
Mrs. T—— was delivered of another male infant,
completely formed, and apparently in perfect health;
the child however fell a victim to the measles at the
age of three months. <i>Dr. Granville</i>, in a paper
<a id='ent'></a>entitled “On the Mal-formation of the Uterine
System,”<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c011'><sup>[425]</sup></a> takes occasion to observe with respect to
the above case, that “it merely goes to prove the
occasional co-existence of separate ova in utero,
and proves nothing farther; the lady, whose prolific
disposition is much descanted upon in that paper, and
with whom twin cases were a common occurrence,”
continues Dr. Granville, “was delivered of a male
child sometime in November, 1807, ‘<em>under circumstances
very distressing to the parents, and on a bundle
of straw</em>,’ and again in February, 1808, of another
male infant, ‘<em>completely formed</em>!’—mark the expression,
for it was not made use of in describing the
first. The former died ‘<em>without any apparent cause</em>’
when nine days old; the other lived longer. Now
can we consider this otherwise than as a common
case of twins, in which one of the fœtuses came into
the world at the sixth, and the other at the ninth
month of pregnancy, owing to the ova being quite
distinct and separate? Had this not been the case,
the <em>distressing circumstances</em>, which brought on the
premature contraction of the womb, so as to expel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span><em>part</em> of its contents in November, as in the simplest
cases of premature labour, would have caused the
expulsion of the whole, or in other words, of both
ova, in that same month; and we should not have
heard of the second <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">accouchement</span></i> in the following
February; which led the author of the paper in
question to bring the case forward as one of superfœtation,
in opposition to what he has called ‘the
scepticism of modern physiologists.’ Had it been
proved that the child, of which the body in question
was delivered, had <em>reached its full term</em> of utero-gestation
in November, and that she had brought
forth another child one, two, or three months afterwards,
of equally full growth, then a case something
like superfœtation would have really occurred, and
scepticism would have been staggered.” In consequence
of the doubts thus expressed by <i>Dr. Granville</i>,
the author of the present work, actuated only
by a desire after truth, applied to <i>Dr. Maton</i> for a
farther explanation of those particular points upon
which the merits of the case would seem to turn; and
he is thus enabled to clear up the doubts which
might be supposed to embarrass its history; the fact
is, that <em>both the children were born perfect</em>, the first
therefore <em>could not</em> have been a six month’s child;
and with respect to the <em>distressing circumstances</em>
which attended the delivery, <i>Dr. Granville</i> appears
to have fallen into an important error; he speaks of
them as having “brought on the premature contraction
of the womb, so as to expel <em>part</em> of its contents
in November,” whereas upon referring to the
particular expressions used by <i>Dr. Maton</i> in the
paper alluded to, we shall soon perceive that they by
no means support the assumption of the labour having
been <em>premature</em>, nor that it was <em>brought on</em> by distressing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>circumstances; on the contrary, we find upon
farther inquiry that the distressing circumstances to
which the author alludes were the natural consequence,
not the active cause of the labour; indeed
the fact, as we learn from <i>Dr. Maton</i>, stood thus,—the
lady could not obtain better accommodation at
the time; that the labour, although quick, was not
sudden, for the accoucheur was already in attendance;
and that it was not premature, for the natural period
of utero-gestation was supposed to have been completed.
We must not omit to state that all the particular
circumstances of the case were communicated
to <i>Dr. Maton</i> by the husband of the lady, and as he
could not have had any particular theory to maintain,
or any private interest to serve, there cannot exist
any good reason for questioning the veracity of his
testimony, or the justness of our conclusions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several physiologists who have attempted to explain
the cause of superfœtation have supposed that
in such cases the uterus is virtually <em>double</em>; <i>Morgagni</i>
informs us, that <i>Catti</i>, the Neapolitan anatomist, was
the first to observe this phenomenon, and that it is
owing to a strong membrane which so divides the
uterus, that the mouth of a fallopian tube corresponds
with each of its cavities; and he farther states, that
this strange structure was found combined with a
corresponding division of the vagina; <i>Valisnieri</i><a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c011'><sup>[426]</sup></a>
also met with a double uterus, and a double vulva;
the same malformation has been noticed by <i>Littre</i>,<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c011'><sup>[427]</sup></a>
<i>Bauhuin</i>,<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c011'><sup>[428]</sup></a> <i>Eissenmann</i>,<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c011'><sup>[429]</sup></a> <i>Haller</i>,<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c011'><sup>[430]</sup></a> and by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span><i>Rhoederer</i>; this latter physiologist in a letter, from
Strasburgh, preserved among the Sloane manuscripts,
says, “We have got here a great curiosity, viz. a
woman body of eighteen years of age, who has the
natural parts externally well formed, but internally
two vaginæ, each with its <em>hymen</em>, to which responds
also an uterus duplex having two orificia, each of
’em hanging in its proper vagina, that in such a manner
there is quite a double system of generation, and
if she had been living a superfœtation could have been
formed.” <i>Sabbatier</i> says that he believes in the possibility
of superfœtation, and that the above formation
will explain its occurrence; an opinion which is
sanctioned by <i>Gravel</i><a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c011'><sup>[431]</sup></a> and <i>Teichmeyer</i>;<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c011'><sup>[432]</sup></a> <i>Duffien</i>
also observes, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cette double matrice sert très bien a
expliquer la superfœtation</span></i>.”<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c011'><sup>[433]</sup></a> In quadrupeds superfœtation
very commonly occurs, and it has been explained
by supposing that the uterus of these animals
is divided into different cells, and that their ova do
not attach themselves to the uterus so early as in the
human subject, but are supposed to receive their
nourishment for some time by absorption; hence the
os uteri does not close immediately after conception;
for a bitch will admit a variety of dogs while she is
in season, and will bring forth puppies of these different
species; thus, it is common for a greyhound
to have in the same litter, one of the greyhound
kind, a pointer, and a third or more, different from
both.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c011'><sup>[434]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Those physiologists who deny the possibility of
superfœtation, among whom we find some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>most celebrated names, assert that one conception
can never supervene another in the same woman,
because <em>the os uteri is closed by coaguable lymph, and
the entrance to the fallopian tubes is obstructed by the
Decidua Uteri, soon after conception</em>, and therefore
that the semen can never find its way to the internal
organs of generation, so as to impregnate a second
ovum; this opinion is fortified by the well known
aphorism of <i>Hippocrates</i>,<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c011'><sup>[435]</sup></a> “οκοσαὶ εν γαστρὶ εχουσὶ; τουτεων δε στομα των υστερων ξυμμεμυκεν.”
<i>Galen</i><a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c011'><sup>[436]</sup></a> also quoting <i>Herophilus</i>
says, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ne specilli quidem mucronem admittere
uteros antequam mulier pariat; prœterea ne vel minimum
quidem hiscere ubi conceperint</span></i>.” Neither <i>Galen</i>,
however, nor <i>Ætius</i>, nor <i>Paulus Ægineta</i>, make any
mention of superfœtation, a circumstance upon which
the opponents of the doctrine lay considerable stress.
<i>Avicenna</i> alludes to it, but for the purpose of expressing
his disbelief in its possibility. <i>Hebenstreit</i><a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c011'><sup>[437]</sup></a>
and <i>Ludwig</i>,<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c011'><sup>[438]</sup></a> have also expressed very strong
opinions upon the subject; the former of whom observes,
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nullæ fere observationes extra omnem dubitationem
positæ superfœtationem confirmant</span></i>.” <i>Baudelocque</i><a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c011'><sup>[439]</sup></a>
is equally hostile to such a belief. But
it may be said that the argument founded on the
entire closure of the uterus is quite gratuitous, many
authorities might be cited who disavow the fact, we
have already adduced the opinion of <i>Haller</i> upon this
point; besides, are we sufficiently acquainted with
the manner in which impregnation is effected to
authorise any deductions from our hypothesis? We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>are completely ignorant in what way the male semen
arrives at the internal organs,<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c011'><sup>[440]</sup></a> nay, we are not
even convinced that its direct transmission to the
ovaria is essential to fecundation; it is possible that
these organs may be stimulated by sympathy with the
vagina. <i>Parsons</i> opposes another argument to the
doctrine of superfœtation; it is, says he, impossible,
because the fallopian tubes become after conception
too short to embrace the ovaria, but this opinion is
successfully combated by <i>Haller</i>. The cases which
have been cited to illustrate the phenomenon of superfœtation,
are regarded by those who oppose the doctrine
as instances in which a plurality of children has
existed, and in which one of the following circumstances
have occurred, viz.</p>

<p class='c019'>1. The fœtus has prematurely died, but has remained
in utero with the living child, to the
full period of utero-gestation.</p>
<p class='c019'>2. The descent of the ova into the uterus from
the ovarium, has not observed the same
order of time, one being more slowly evolved
than another, although both might have
been fecundated by the same coitus.</p>

<p class='c000'>This latter was the favourite idea of <i>Celoni</i>:<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c011'><sup>[441]</sup></a>
“I am therefore decidedly of opinion,” says he,
“that this superfœtation is no other than a later
developement of a fœtus contemporaneously generated.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>We have thus presented the reader with a review
of the different arguments which have been adopted
by the partisans and opponents of this celebrated
doctrine, and we have cited copious authorities with
a view to enable the student to pursue the investigation
to any extent which may be commensurate
with his notions of its importance. We shall now
conclude by observing that the following occurrences
are essential to constitute a case of superfœtation.<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c011'><sup>[442]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c019'>1. The pregnant woman must bear two children,
each of a distinct age.</p>
<p class='c019'>2. The delivery of these children must take place
at different times, with a considerable interval
between each.</p>
<p class='c019'>3. The woman must be pregnant and a nurse at
the same time.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>Q. 10. <i>What are the causes of Abortion?</i></h4>

<p class='c013'>A gratuitous assumption on the part of some writers
respecting the <em>viability</em> of the fœtus, has led them to
adopt a division into <em>abortion</em> and <em>premature labour</em>,
according as the exclusion from the uterus takes
place before, or after, the sixth month of conception;
and the distinction is now generally adopted. Natural
abortion may be considered as arising either from
accidental or constitutional causes; we shall hereafter
consider the different modes by which the premature
ejectment of a fœtus may be occasioned by art. The
exciting causes of accidental abortion may, in general,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>be easily detected<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c011'><sup>[443]</sup></a>; those giving rise to the
constitutional kind are often more obscure, and without
great attention, the woman will go on to miscarry
until either sterility or some fatal disease be induced.
In many cases there can be no peculiar pre-disposing
cause; as, for instance, when it is produced by blows,
rupture of the membranes, or accidental separation
of the decidua; but where it occurs without any very
perceptible exciting cause, it is allowable to infer
that some pre-disposing state exists, and this frequently
consists in an imperfect mode of uterine action,
induced by age, former miscarriages, and other
causes. It is well known that women can only bear
children until a certain age, after which the uterus
is no longer capable of performing the action of gestation,
or of performing it properly; now it is observable,
that this incapability or imperfection takes place
sooner in those who are advanced in life before they
marry, than in those who have married and begun to
bear children earlier; thus we find, that a woman
who marries at forty shall be very apt to miscarry;
whereas, had she married at thirty, she might have
borne children when older than forty, from which it
may be inferred, that the organs of generation lose
their power of acting properly sooner, if not employed,
than in the connubial state.<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c011'><sup>[444]</sup></a> We also find
that one miscarriage renders the woman liable to the
accident at the same period of utero-gestation in subsequent
labours, and to such an extent is this susceptibility
carried, that it is often difficult with every precaution,
for a woman to go to the full time, after she
has miscarried frequently. These are circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>which the juridical physician is, for obvious reasons,
to keep in mind; females of disreputable character
have been frequently known to miscarry repeatedly
in succession; and in such cases we ought
not, without very cogent reasons, to draw an inference
that may subject them to accusation. We do
not consider that any farther observations are required
upon this subject, as the numerous works upon
midwifery are ready to supply the practitioner with a
solution of any problem which may present itself.</p>

<h4 class='c012'>Q. 11. <i>Under what circumstances, and by what means, is it morally, legally, and medically proper, to induce premature labour?</i></h4>

<p class='c013'>That premature labour may be induced by a mechanical
operation, is too well known to the practitioner
in midwifery to require any explanation in this
place, while, in a work calculated for circulation beyond
the confines of the profession, it would be obviously
imprudent to enter into any minute details.
It becomes our duty, however, to state, that in those
cases of distorted pelvis, through which a full grown
fœtus cannot pass without mutilation, the operation
may be performed with perfect safety, and with equal
advantage both to the child and to the mother. We
are informed by <i>Dr. Denman</i><a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c011'><sup>[445]</sup></a> that there was in
1756 a consultation of the most eminent men in London
at that time, to consider of the moral rectitude
of, and advantages which might be expected from, this
practice, which met with their general approbation;
the morality of this mode of practice, however, says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span><i>Dr. Merriman</i>,<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c011'><sup>[446]</sup></a> has been doubted by many other
persons, but probably for want of considering the
question in a proper point of view; for the proposal
was, that labour should be prematurely induced, <em>in
those cases only</em>, where it had been <em>decidedly proved</em>
that the pelvis was so much contracted in its dimensions,
as to render it impossible for a full sized fœtus
to pass undiminished; and it is supposed, that this
proceeding, while it affords a chance of preserving
the child, does not much implicate the life of the
mother. <i>Mr. J. Barlow</i><a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c011'><sup>[447]</sup></a> has given us the result
of an extensive practice in inducing premature labour
in cases of distorted pelvis, from which it appears
that he has had recourse to this method of delivery
<em>eighteen</em> times, in five women, all of whom had
been previously delivered once, or oftener, by the
crotchet, and that premature labour occurred spontaneously
once in two of this number. All the women
recovered, a circumstance which adds a further confirmation
to the opinion, that the life of the parent is
exposed to very little hazard in this way; of the children
thus brought into the world, <em>six</em> were dead and
<em>twelve</em> were born alive, of which some died soon after
birth, <em>one</em> lived ten months, and <em>five</em> were living at
the time the account was published. <i>Mr. Barlow’s</i>
method consists in exciting premature labour <em>early</em> in
the <em>seventh</em> month of pregnancy. <i>Dr. Hull</i>, well
known for his controversial zeal on these subjects, has
offered some remarks so judicious and important,
that it would be an act of injustice to withhold them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>from the reader. “The propriety of inducing premature
labour,” says he, “in any deformed woman,
can rarely, if ever, be determined upon before the
crotchet has been found indispensably necessary, and
actually employed in a previous labour; indeed, unless
the contraction of the tube or canal of the pelvis
be very considerable and pretty accurately ascertained,
it will scarcely be justifiable in any case to
have recourse to this practice in all the subsequent
pregnancies, until the woman has been delivered a
second, or third time, by the crotchet; for it has
happened in a very great number of instances, that a
woman who has been delivered of her first child by
the perforator and crotchet, has been afterwards delivered
of one or more living children, at the full time;
this observation is made not to discountenance the inducing
of premature labour, but to prevent the abuse
of it.” <i>Dr. Merriman</i>, whose extensive practice, and
generally acknowledged judgment, stamp a peculiar
value upon his opinions, has also pointed out the limitations
and cautions which he deems necessary to
be observed, to render this operation safe and eligible,<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c011'><sup>[448]</sup></a>
and he concludes by observing that “<em>a regard
to his own character should determine the accoucheur,
not to perform this operation, unless some other respectable
practitioner has seen the patient, and has acknowledged
that the operation is advisable</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>Where the size of the pelvis<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c011'><sup>[449]</sup></a> will not admit the
passage of the child, surgical aid is indispensably necessary;
but, says <i>Dr. Merriman</i>,<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c011'><sup>[450]</sup></a> it becomes every
man to set out with a determination that he will
not hastily, nor without due cause, have recourse to
instrumental assistance;<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c011'><sup>[451]</sup></a> for he may assure himself

<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>or to the expressions of alarm by the attendants
in the lying-in chamber, and in consequence
were to try to expedite the delivery by his instruments,
he would, on very many occasions, do irreparable
injury to the parent or her child.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instrumental delivery resolves itself into three
classes,—</p>

    <div><i>Of the Cæsarean Operation</i>:</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>By which a fœtus is extracted from the uterus of
the mother through a wound, made for that purpose,
in the abdomen. The term <em>Cæsarean</em>, according to
some authors, is derived from the operation “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæso matris
utero</span></i>,” while others have supposed that it owes
its origin to the fact, recorded by <i>Suidas</i>, of Julius
Cæsar having been cut from the womb of his dead
mother in the ninth month. Although <i>Hippocrates</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span><i>Celsus</i>, <i>Paulus</i>, <i>Ægineta</i>, and <i>Albucasis</i>, all treat upon
the subject of instrumental labours, not the slightest
allusion is made to the <i>cæsarean</i> section. The <i>Chirurgia
Guidonis Cauliaci</i> is the first work in which any
mention is made of the operation; and this was published
about the middle of the fourteenth century,
but the author only describes it as a resource to save
the child after the death of the mother, as, says he,
happened at the birth of <i>Julius Cæsar</i>. <i>Parè</i> also
considered the operation as one that ought never to be
attempted on the living subject; <i>Rousset</i>, however,
his cotemporary, published a work<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c011'><sup>[454]</sup></a> in its favour,
which becoming popular, was, through the medium
of a latin translation by <i>Caspar Bauhine</i> in 1601,
quickly circulated throughout Europe; from this period,
the cæsarean section acquired a certain degree
of vogue, and began to be performed in cases of extreme
difficulty, particularly on the continent, where
it has not unfrequently proved successful. In this
country the operation has been generally fatal: a very
extraordinary case<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c011'><sup>[455]</sup></a> is, however, stated to have occurred
in Ireland, and however incredible the story
may appear, says <i>Dr. Merriman</i>,<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c011'><sup>[456]</sup></a> there seems no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>reason to doubt its truth; it is related by <i>Mr. Duncan
Stewart</i>, surgeon, in Dungannon, who saw the
patient some days after the operation; and the account
is confirmed by <i>Dr. Gabriel King</i> of Armagh,
who says, that he drew out the needles, which the
midwife had left to keep the lips of the wound together.
The patient’s name was <i>Alice O’Neil</i>, and
the operator was an illiterate midwife, one <i>Mary Dunally</i>;
the instrument used was a razor, with which
she first cut through the containing parts of the abdomen,
and then the uterus. “She held the lips of
the wound together with her hand, till some one
went a mile and returned with silk and the common
needles which tailors use; with these she joined the
lips in the manner of the stitch employed ordinarily
for the hare-lip, and dressed the wound with whites
of eggs.” The woman recovered in twenty-seven
days. It has often been an object of inquiry, why this
operation<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c011'><sup>[457]</sup></a> should have been more successful upon
the continent than in this country? the answer to
this question is obvious and satisfactory. In this
country we have only had recourse to it as an operation
of necessity, where we can neither accomplish
the delivery by diminishing the bulk of the child, nor
by any of the other resources already explained;
whereas the practitioners of France, and the other
states on the continent of Europe, perform it not only
as an operation of necessity, but as one of election,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>in cases where the mother may confessedly be delivered
with safety, by sacrificing the life of the fœtus;
it would also appear that in general they have recourse
to the operation, before the patient has suffered
very much from the continuance of labour. How
greatly this circumstance is capable of influencing the
success of a surgical operation, we have a satisfactory
demonstration in the history of that for <i>Hernia</i>, and
in which <i>Mr. Bell</i><a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c011'><sup>[458]</sup></a> informs us, the French were
formerly more fortunate, because they proceeded
more early to the operation than the surgeons of almost
any other nation. It deserves notice that the
religious tenets of different countries appear to have
influenced the popularity of the cæsarean section; it
is easy to suppose that in those catholic nations where,
a belief exists of the necessity of baptism to secure
the eternal happiness of the infant, the mother would
become a willing sacrifice to make her offspring a
christian.<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c011'><sup>[459]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In delivering our opinion upon the propriety of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>performing the cæsarean section in this kingdom, we
should say that there are cases in which it is the
bounden duty of the accoucheur to proceed without
delay, and such appears to have been that described
by <i>Dr. Merriman</i>, of which the pelvis in the museum
of <i>Mr. Charles Bell</i> is a sufficient proof; for so extreme
is the distortion, that a marble measuring less
than one inch in diameter, cannot be made to pass
through it in any direction; in this case, and some
others of a similar nature, the <i>Cæsarean</i> section was
the only means of preserving the child. We are of
opinion, however, that the operation ought never to
be performed where by <i>Embryulcia</i> the child can be
extricated; and although circumstances of inheritance
should induce the husband to entertain a feeling like
that which animated Henry VIII, the practitioner
has but one broad line of duty to observe, to save if
possible the mother and child, but where this is impossible,
to feel no hesitation in sacrificing the life of
the latter. In the event of a woman, near the full
time of pregnancy, dying undelivered, the <i>Cæsarean</i>
operation ought always to be performed with as little
loss of time as possible; since by this measure a
chance of preserving the child will be afforded, and
<i>Dr. Merriman</i> states that several cases of such an
operation, after the death of the mother, have been
recorded, with the desired effect of saving the infant.<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c011'><sup>[460]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span><i>Numa Pompilius</i> prohibited the burial of a
pregnant woman until the fœtus shall have been extracted.<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c011'><sup>[461]</sup></a>
We have already stated, upon the authority
of <i>Suidas</i>, that to such an interposition Rome
owed the life of <i>Julius Cæsar</i>; and it has been maintained
that <i>Edward</i> VI was thus taken from his
mother after death, while others have endeavoured
to render it probable, that the cæsarean operation was
performed while she was yet living. How long after
the death of the mother the child may survive <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in utero</span></i>,
is a question which cannot be readily answered; some
authors<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c011'><sup>[462]</sup></a> mention twenty-four or even forty-eight
hours; and in relating this fact, <i>Dr. Merriman</i> adds an
accompaniment which we also feel a great inclination
to adopt—<em>a note of admiration</em>! In the late <i>Dr. S. H.
Jackson’s Cautions to Women</i> (1798) mention is made
of a child extracted by the <em>forceps</em>, which was restored
to life, though the mother had been dead full half an
hour before it was taken from the womb.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>It must be admitted, that a child taken from the
womb of its mother by the cæsarean section, cannot
in philological strictness <a id='been'></a>be said to have been <em>born</em>.
The ingenious purpose to which <i>Shakspeare</i> has applied
this quibble has no doubt suggested itself to the
reader.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>OF EXTRA-UTERINE CONCEPTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>It sometimes happens, that instead of the impregnated
ovum passing into the womb, it is either retained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>in the ovarium,<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c011'><sup>[463]</sup></a> or it stops in the fallopian
tube, or it misses the tube and falls amongst the
bowels. Of these, the <em>tubal</em> is by far more frequent
than the <em>ventral</em> conception. We learn from the numerous
cases which are recorded of extra-uterine
pregnancy, that it may terminate in several different
ways; in some cases sudden death occurs from hemorrhage;<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c011'><sup>[464]</sup></a>
in others, the unfortunate woman survives
for a long period; and it has occurred that the
fœtus has been converted into a substance somewhat
analogous to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gras de cimetières</span></i>,<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c011'><sup>[465]</sup></a> in which case
very little inconvenience is felt beyond that which
must attend the tumour of the belly for so many
years. Nature, however, more generally institutes
a process to get rid of the extraneous body; the sac
adheres to the peritoneum or intestines, and, after an
uncertain period, varying from a few weeks to several
years, it either opens externally, or communicates with
the abdominal viscera, and highly offensive matter,
together with putrid flesh, bones, and coaguli, are
discharged through the abdominal integuments, or
by the rectum,<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c011'><sup>[466]</sup></a> vagina, or bladder.<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c011'><sup>[467]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The most extraordinary circumstance in the history
of these conceptions is the sympathetic enlargement of
the uterus, and even in some cases, the formation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Membrana Decidua</span></i>.<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c011'><sup>[468]</sup></a> <i>Riolanus</i><a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c011'><sup>[469]</sup></a> was the
first person who noticed these conceptions. <i>Vesalius</i>
observed a <em>tubal</em> conception at Paris in 1669; the fœtus
was four months old, and the tube was so enlarged,
that he mistook it for a second uterus, and
actually published an account of it, under the title of
“<cite>Demonstration d’une double Matrice</cite>.” <i>De Graaf</i>,
and afterwards a learned German by the name of
<i>Elshotius</i> commented upon this case in a tract entitled
“<cite>De Conceptione Tubaria, qua humani fœtus extra
uteri cavitatem in tubis quandoque concipiuntur</cite>,” in
which is given the figure of the two supposed <em>uteri</em>,
and the fœtus in the distended tube. In the <cite>Journal
des Sçavans</cite>, A. D. 1678, a case is recorded of a woman
at Paris who carried an <em>extra-uterine</em> fœtus in
the omentum for twenty years; and in the <cite>Philosophical
Transactions</cite> there is an account of a fœtus of
this description, by <i>Dr. Steigerthal</i>, that remained in
the body of the mother for upwards of <em>forty</em> years.
In the present state of our physiological knowledge
it is impossible to offer any explanation of the cause
of these anomalies in the law of Nature, but we recommend
to the attention of the student a paper by
<i>Dr. Blundell</i>, on the Physiology of Generation, to
which we have before taken occasion to allude<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c011'><sup>[470]</sup></a> in
terms of high commendation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>OF HERMAPHRODITES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The term <i>Hermaphrodite</i><a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c011'><sup>[471]</sup></a> signifies an animal in
which there exists a mixture of the male and female
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>organs, and which is therefore capable of begetting
or conceiving. There can be no doubt but that some
of the lower orders of animals<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c011'><sup>[472]</sup></a> are, in the strict
sense of the term, Hermaphrodites; but it is now
universally admitted that, in the human species, no
such phenomenon ever existed; indeed, if we only
consider the osteology of the pelvis, to the bones of
which the organs of generation are connected, it is
impossible to imagine how the complete parts of the
male and female could be placed distinct from each
other; nor is there upon record a single case which
can be considered authentic;<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c011'><sup>[473]</sup></a> numerous are the
instances of preternatural structure, which gives the
appearance of a double sex, and it is on the nature of
such monstrous productions, that the medical man is
frequently called upon to decide. <i>Baron Haller</i> has
industriously collected in one point of view, the histories
of reputed hermaphrodites, from almost every
author that has preceded him; and from this memoir,<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c011'><sup>[474]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>and the interesting paper by <i>Sir E. Home</i>,
entitled “An account of the Dissection of an Hermaphrodite
Dog, to which are prefixed some observations
on Hermaphrodites in general,”<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c011'><sup>[475]</sup></a> we acknowledge
ourselves principally indebted for the following
remarks.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Sir E. Home</i> considers that all the monstrous productions,
hitherto noticed and described as Hermaphrodites,
may be reduced to one of the <em>four</em> following
classes, viz:</p>

<p class='c019'>1. <i>Malformations of the Male.</i> 2. <i>Malformations
of the Female.</i> 3. <i>Males with such a deficiency
in their organs, that they have not the
character and general properties of the male,
and may be called</i> <span class='sc'>Neuters</span>. 4. <i>Where
there exists a real mixture of the organs of
both sexes, although not sufficiently complete
to constitute double organs.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>To illustrate the first case, we may refer to that of
a negro described by <i>Cheselden</i>,<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c011'><sup>[476]</sup></a> who would appear
to have possessed the organs of the male exclusively,
only in a state of great distortion, owing to
the imperfection of the <em>scrotum</em>, which was divided into
two separate bags with a deep slit between them, resembling
very much the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">labia pudendi</span></i>, and the opening
into the vagina; over these hung down the penis;
the imperfection of the septum of the <em>scrotum</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>extended to the canal of the <em>urethra</em>; this is not unlike
the fissure of the hare-lip being continued through
the bony palate, a circumstance often met with. The
under surface of the <em>penis</em> was attached, through its
whole length, to the two bags containing the testicles,
looking like a preternatural <em>clitoris</em>; to which it bore a
more perfect resemblance from the absence of the <em>urethra</em>.
The urine passed through a preternatural termination
of the <em>urethra</em> in the <em>perineum</em>, and came
out externally in the space between the testicles,
which formed an enlarged aperture that had been
mistaken for a narrow vagina, in consequence of its
allowing an instrument to pass to some distance, by
conducting it to the bladder. Such mal-formation of
the male organs<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c011'><sup>[477]</sup></a> is particularly worthy attention,
for it is that, more than any other, which has given
origin<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c011'><sup>[478]</sup></a> to mistakes respecting the mixture of the
sexes. The <em>lusus</em> often occurs in different degrees of
imperfection, and may in some instances be materially
diminished by art. In the <em>second</em> case, it may be observed
that there are two mal-formations of the female
organs of generation, which may give to the external
parts a doubtful character; one is an enlargement
of the <em>clitoris</em>; the other, a protrusion of the internal
parts. It has been already stated that enlargements
of the <em>clitoris</em> are not of rare occurrence, especially
in hot climates; and that at birth it is often
larger than the penis, and has frequently given rise to
mistakes; so that females have been baptised as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>males.<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c011'><sup>[479]</sup></a> The following <a id='rem'></a>remarks may serve to lead
to a correct decision upon these occasions:—If the
subject be a female, the labia are well formed, and
when handled no round bodies are felt in them like
testicles; the fissure at the extremity of the glans
does not communicate with any canal of the urethra;
but under the glans, and at the posterior extremity of
the fissure, there is an opening which leads immediately
to the bladder.<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c011'><sup>[480]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The other mal-formation of the female genital organs
consists in a protrusion of the internal parts, of
which we have already given an example (<i>see page</i>
<a href='#Page_28'>28</a>); the womb when thus displaced, has assumed so
close a resemblance to the penis, that it has been actually
mistaken for one by medical men of the highest
character, as in the instance related by <i>Sir. E. Home</i>
in his paper upon Hermaphrodites; another case is
also published in the <em>fifteenth</em> volume of the <cite>Philosophical
Transactions</cite>, in which the menses periodically
flowed through the orifice of the supposed penis.
With respect to the third order of imagined hermaphrodites,
which <i>Sir E. Home</i> has called <em>neuters</em>,
and where the subject, although a male, has not, in
consequence of organic defects, the characters of his
sex, has been said to be more common than is generally
supposed, especially in early life, and that by
farther developement the anomalies have sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>disappeared; it is, probably, as <i>Sir E. Home</i> very
justly observes, only those whose form is very like
females, that have attracted the notice of common observers,
so as to have their defects discovered. <i>Ambrose
Paré</i> mentions a case, where by violent exertion,
the male organs of generation became suddenly developed,
and the person who had before been considered
as a female, was admitted to the rights of manhood;
and a similar case is recorded by <i>M. Veay</i>, as having
happened at Thoulouse, (<cite>see also Montaigne’s <a id='ess'></a>Essay,
chap.</cite> xx.) The examples which fall under the fourth
order are very uncommon in <a id='occ'></a>occurrence,—where there
is a real mixture of the organs of both sexes, although
not sufficiently complete to constitute double
organs; indeed we are very much inclined to question
whether a real participation of the nature of both
sexes ever takes place; in almost every case where
due examination has been made, such persons have
been found to belong decidedly to the one sex or to
the other. <i>Petit</i><a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c011'><sup>[481]</sup></a> has reported the dissection of a
soldier, aged twenty-two, who had not only the testes
in the abdomen, but also a womb, and nearly the
whole apparatus of the female genitals; in this, as
well as similar stories, we are disposed to think with
<i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i>,<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c011'><sup>[482]</sup></a> that things have been called
by wrong names.<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c011'><sup>[483]</sup></a></p>

and more especially if a commission of lunacy is about
to be issued, the court will enlarge the time for the
return of the writ according to the nature of the case,
(<i>Rex v. Clarke</i>, 3 <i>Burr R.</i> 1363.) And if liberty to
have access and inspection of such lunatic be applied
for, it must be on behalf of some person who has
pretension to demand it, or the Court will reject the
request (ibid.)<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c011'><sup>[499]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>But though no commission has issued, the Court of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>Chancery will interpose, as where the Lord Chancellor
stopped a lunatic from being carried out of the jurisdiction
of the Court (into Scotland), Lady <i>Marr’s case</i>,
cited in Lady <i>Annadale’s case</i>. <i>Amb.</i> 82. The Court
also retains some jurisdiction after the death of the
lunatic, <i>Ex parte Grimstone, Ambler.</i> 706; <i>Ex parte
Armstrong</i>, 3 <i>Bro. Ch. Ca.</i> 238; <i>Fitz-gerald’s Case</i>,
2 <i>Sch. and Lef.</i> 439.<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c011'><sup>[500]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Formerly the inquiry respecting idiots and lunatics
was made by Writs to the Escheator or Sheriff as an
officer to enquire of the revenues of the Crown, (<i>F. N.
B.</i> p. 531: 1 <i>Collinson</i>, 117: <i>Ex parte Southcote</i>, 2 <i>Ves.</i>
401:) but these being very strict as to the wording,
and as no person could be found idiot or lunatic under
them, except those who came under the strict definition
of either denomination, the Writs have been superseded
by Commissions<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c011'><sup>[501]</sup></a> of a more comprehensive
character under the great seal<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c011'><sup>[502]</sup></a>. These Commissions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>are directed to five Commissioners,<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c011'><sup>[503]</sup></a> who,
or any three or more of them, are openly to enquire
on the oaths of twelve or more good and lawful men,
whether the person be or not an idiot, lunatic, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non
compos</span></i>: 1 <i>Collinson</i>, 120. And they have power to
issue their warrant to any person to produce the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non
compos</span></i><a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c011'><sup>[504]</sup></a>, <i>ib.</i> 143; which, if not obeyed, will be enforced
by the Lord Chancellor, and costs decreed, if
required against the persons having the custody of the
party. <i>Ex parte Southcote</i>, 2 <i>Ves.</i> 401. 405: see also
Lord <i>Wenman’s</i> case<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c011'><sup>[505]</sup></a> <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ubi supra</span></i>. The Commissioners
have also power to summon witnesses as incident
to their office. <i>Ex parte Lund</i>, 6 <i>Ves.</i> 784.<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c011'><sup>[506]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Where there is any misbehaviour in the execution
of a Commission, whether by the <a id='comm'></a>Commissioners, or
Jury, (<i>Ex parte Roberts</i>, 3 <i>Atk.</i> 6.) the Chancellor
will quash it, and direct a new Commission.</p>

<p class='c000'>If there has been a finding against the king, there
may be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a melius inquirendum</span></i>, but this is for the Crown
only (3 <i>Atk.</i> 6.), which cannot traverse as the subject
can.</p>

<p class='c000'>The remedy of the subject is by traversing the inquisition,
or by bringing the question to an issue at
law. The right of traverse has been disputed; Sir
<i>John Cutt’s</i> case, <i>Ley.</i> 26. 3 <i>Atk.</i> 6.; and it was held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>that permission to traverse was a favour granted by
the Court, and not a right; <i>ibid.</i> but it is now established
to be <i>de jure</i> under the 2 <i>Ed.</i> 6. c. 8. § 6. <i>Ex
parte Wragg</i>, and <i>ex parte Ferne</i>, 5 <i>Ves.</i> 450. 832.
But the petition of a stranger for this purpose will
be dismissed with costs: <i>Ex parte Ward.</i> 6 <i>Ves.</i> 579.</p>

<p class='c000'>The manner of pleading a traverse is very short,
(5 <i>Ves.</i> 452). An idiot must traverse in person.
<i>Smithson’s</i> case was on motion to be permitted to traverse
by attorney, which was opposed; it was agreed
that a traverse was given by 2 <i>Ed.</i> 6, but it must be
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propriâ personâ</span></i>: precedents were shown, but there
was no case where an idiot had traversed by attorney,
though many where a lunatic had: 3 <i>Atk.</i> 7. Vide
<i>Stone’s</i> case in <cite>Tremaine’s Pleas of the Crown</cite>, 653,
a precedent of a traverse, and for the doctrine of traversing
an inquisition, vide 4 <i>Co.</i> 54. <i>b</i>; (the case
of the Commonalty of the Sadlers), and 8 <i>Co.</i> 168.
<i>Xaris Storeghtors’</i> case. Sir <i>T. Jones</i>, 198. <i>Show.</i>
199. <i>Skinner</i>, 45. <i>Moseley</i>, 71. 1 <i>Collinson</i>, 171.
But though a lunatic may by permission of the Lord
Chancellor traverse by attorney, the better rule is that
he attend in person. <i>Amb.</i> 112.</p>

<p class='c000'>The appeal in lunacy is to the King in Council, and
not to the House of Lords. <i>Ex parte Pitt</i>, 3 <i>P. Wms.</i>
108: <i>Rochfort and Ely</i>, 6. <i>Bro. Par. Ca.</i> 329; <i>Sheldon
v. Aland</i>, 3 <i>P. Wms.</i> 107.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the party be found lunatic the next consideration
is as to the disposal of his person and estate. “To
prevent sinister practices, the next heir is seldom
permitted to be this committee of the person; because
it is his interest that the party should die.
But it hath been said there lies not the same objection
against his next of kin, provided he be not his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>heir; for it is his interest to preserve the lunatic’s
life, in order to increase the personal estate by
savings, which he or his family may hereafter be
entitled to enjoy. The heir is generally made the
manager or committee of the estate, it being clearly
his interest by good management to keep it in condition;
accountable however to the Court of Chancery,
and to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non compos</span></i> himself if he recovers;
or otherwise to his administrators, 1 <i>Bl. Comm.</i> 305.
But this rule is not in all cases adhered to, <i>Ex
parte Cockayne</i>, 7 <i>Ves.</i> 591: <i>Neal’s case</i>, 2 <i>P. Wms.</i>
544, and <i>ex parte Ludlow</i>, <i>ibid.</i> 635.” The Court
will not give the custody of a lunatic to one who
may make a gain of it, Lady <i>Cope’s</i> case, <i>Cha. Ca.</i>
239, or allow the committee any thing for his trouble,
whether as to the person (<i>In re Annesley. Amb.</i> 78)
or as to the estate, 10 <i>Ves.</i> 103.</p>

<p class='c000'>A stranger may have the custody of a lunatic, <i>Ch.
Ca.</i> 239. And where no one could be procured to
act as committee of a lunatic, a receiver was appointed
with a salary, but nevertheless to be considered
and give security as a committee. <i>Ex parte
Warren</i>, 10 <i>Ves.</i> 622.</p>

<p class='c000'>A committee may be removed on sufficient cause,
as bankruptcy, but the Court will not change the
custody, if the Master finds it proper with regard to
the comfort of the lunatic. <i>Ex parte Mildmay</i>, 3
<i>Ves.</i> 2.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where there are sufficient funds, a liberal application
of the property of a lunatic ought to be made,
in order to afford him every comfort his situation will
admit, <i>Ex parte Baker</i>, 6 <i>Ves.</i> 8. <i>ex parte Chumley</i>,
1 <i>Ves. jun.</i> 296. <i>Dormer’s Case</i>, 2 <i>P. Wms.</i> 265.
3 <i>P. Wms.</i> 104. His comfort, where no creditor
complains, is the first object, not the heaping up of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>riches for his next of kin, <i>ib.</i> The Chancellor will
not make an order, even for creditors, the effect of
which would be to put the lunatic in a state of absolute
want, <i>Ex parte Dikes</i>, 8 <i>Ves.</i> 79; nor unless it
is clear that he will have a sufficient maintenance,
<i>Ex parte Hastings</i>, 14 <i>Ves.</i> 182.</p>

<p class='c000'>We are next to consider how a party once found
lunatic, can, upon recovery, resume his natural and
civil rights;<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c011'><sup>[507]</sup></a> for this purpose the strongest medical
as well as general evidence will be necessary, not
only as to absolute recovery, but temporary remissions
or lucid intervals, for if a party be once found non
compos, the finding is conclusive, till evidence be
shown to the contrary, see <i>Hall</i> v. <i>Warren</i>, 9 <i>Ves.</i>
605: <i>Attorn. Gen.</i> v. <i>Parnther</i>, 3 <i>Bro. Ch. Ca.</i> 441:
and if as to a lucid interval there must be this severity
of proof, much more must the onus of proving an
absolute recovery rest with the party seeking to set
aside the former finding of a competent tribunal, or
even to negative an established presumption;—“When
the party has ever been subject to a commission,
or to any restraint permitted by law, even a
domestic restraint, clearly and plainly upon him in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>consequence of undisputed insanity, the proof
shewing sanity is thrown upon him; on the other
hand, where insanity has not been imputed by
relations or friends, or even by common law, the
proof of insanity, (which does not appear ever to
have existed) is thrown upon the other side; which
is not to be made out by rambling through the
whole life of the party; but must be applied to the
particular date of the transaction. A deviation
from that rule will produce great uncertainty.”
Lord <i>Eldon</i> in <i>White and Wilson</i>, 13 <i>Ves.</i> 88; see
also 3 <i>Bro. Ch. Ca.</i> 241. On motion that a recovered
lunatic might settle his estate, Lord Keeper <i>North</i>
refused the motion, but directed an issue in the Common
Pleas to try the fact of the recovery, 1 <i>Vern.</i> 155.
so also Lord <i>Eldon</i> in <i>ex parte Holylands</i>, 11 <i>Ves.</i>
10; but the commission may sometimes be superceded
on inspection, when it is usual for the physician
to attend. 1 <i>Fonb. Tr. Eq.</i> 65. or to make affidavit;
but the former mode is the best.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been said that there are no degrees of defect
of understanding save idiotcy and lunacy, <i>Hume</i> v.
<i>Burton, Ridgw. Par. Ca.</i> 211; this may be true as
relates to commissions of idiotcy or lunacy, and their
consequences, but it is neither legally or medically
correct in any more extended sense.</p>

<p class='c000'>Delirium,<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c011'><sup>[508]</sup></a> in the ordinary acceptation of the word,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>is the temporary derangement of intellect consequent
on acute disease; it may be distinguished from lunacy
or madness by the invariable presence of fever, and it
ceases as its exciting causes subside; this therefore
operates no permanent incapacity; for though the
patient cannot be permitted to do any act, or execute
any <a id='inst'></a>instrument to bind his property or estate, and
would not be held responsible for any crime committed
during such temporary alienation of intellect,
yet he becomes competent to act, and <a id='respons'></a>responsible for
his actions as soon as the paroxysm and its consequences
are clearly over.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there is yet another species of mental disorder
which, since it does not incapacitate the patient from
performing the ordinary duties and offices of life,
does not subject him to the inconveniences of commission
of lunacy, or exempt him from criminal
responsibility; we mean those partial insanities which
are marked by peculiar and unaccountable dislikes,
fancies, and apprehensions, a mental idiocyncrasy on
some one particular subject.<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c011'><sup>[509]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>To take out a commission of lunacy against such a
man would be a greater cruelty than to cure him,
and yet occasionally some legal interference may be
necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a man suffers under a partial derangement
of intellect, and on one point only, it would be unjust
to invalidate acts which were totally distinct
from, and uninfluenced by, this limited insanity; but
if the act done bears a strict and evident reference to
the existing mental delusion, we cannot see why the
law should not also interpose a limited protection,
and still less why Courts of Equity, which, in their
ordinary jurisdiction relieve against mistake, should
deny their aid in such cases.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. <i>Greenwood</i> was bred to the bar and acted as
“Chairman at the Quarter Sessions, but, becoming
diseased, and receiving in a fever a draught from
the hand of his brother, the delirium taking its
ground then, connected itself with that idea; and
he considered his brother as having given him a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>potion, with a view to destroy him<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c011'><sup>[511]</sup></a>. He recovered
in all other respects, but that morbid image
never departed; and that idea appeared connected
with the will, by which he disinherited his brother.
Nevertheless it was considered so necessary to have
some precise rule, that, though a verdict had been
obtained in the Common Pleas against the will,
the judge strongly advised the jury to find the
other way, and they did accordingly find in favour
of the will. Farther proceedings took place afterwards,
and concluded in a compromise.” Lord
<i>Eldon ubi supra</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The records of Bedlam and Saint Lukes are full of
similar instances of persons insane on only one point;
where that point may lead to mischief, it is proper
that the party should be placed under restraint;
where the aberration is harmless, it would be cruel to
add imprisonment to the evil of the disorder, running
also the risk of producing an augmentation of the
disease; for it may safely be taken as a rule, that
persons labouring under limited, will be predisposed
to general insanity, and therefore it is at least necessary
to watch them minutely, lest some less harmless
derangement should seize them at the moment when
it is least expected.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>LUNATIC ASYLUMS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The very gross abuses which were formerly practised
in Lunatic <a id='asy'></a>Asylums, long required legislative
interference, till by the <i>14th Geo.</i> 3, <i>c.</i> 49,<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c011'><sup>[512]</sup></a> many
of the most glaring evils were remedied. As the act
itself is copied in the <i>Appendix, p.</i> 170, we do not
now repeat all its provisions; on a few points however
some comment is necessary, and more especially
as an attempt has been lately made, and is likely to
be renewed, to alter the law on this subject. It is
proposed that, instead of confiding the choice of licensing
and visiting commissioners to the College of
Physicians in London, a permanent officer (and the
name of the individual intended has been even mentioned)
should be appointed by government to execute
those duties: however high the authority of the officer
of State to whom this selection is to be given, we
must doubt whether he can be so competent a judge
of medical proficiency as the learned body to whom
the trust is now confided; and if he be not, the interest
of the public is compromised, that the patronage
of the minister may be increased; for, admitting that
a permanent officer should be appointed, there is no
good reason why his selection should not remain with
a competent authority, which has not yet been found
unworthy of the trust reposed in them. Our principal
objection, however, is to the permanence of the appointment;
under the present system much benefit
arises from the occasional change of visitors, by
which means the unfortunate patients are brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>under the view of a greater number of medical observers
than could be otherwise obtained for them.
A permanent officer may soon be reconciled to abuses,
and become callous to suffering; while under the visitation
of a temporary Committee the subject is kept
fresh and vivid with all the interest of novelty, at
least in the minds of the members last elected. The
period for which each member serves on the committee,
(three years) and the extent of the pecuniary
emolument, hold out no inducement to jobbing or canvas,
even if the learned and honourable body would
allow it, and a consequent security is afforded, that
none will be elected from undue motives; there is always
a risk of a contrary result when a well paid and
permanent office is made the object of patronage; an
improper person is frequently selected, and when
those who have been originally well appointed become
incapable by age, infirmity, or other incapacity,
there is always a delicacy and difficulty in their removal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hitherto we have confined our observations to the
Commissioners for the London district<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c011'><sup>[513]</sup></a>, but our
objections acquire additional weight when we consider
that if the proposed alteration be necessary on
principle, it must extend to the country, and consequently
that above fifty salaried officers must be appointed
to the counties of England and Wales alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bill introduced and passed through the House
of Commons was thrown out in the House of Lords;
and when we reflect upon the legal acumen which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>presides there, we feel confident that any future
similar attempt would meet a similar fate.<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c011'><sup>[514]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The <i>14th Geo.</i> 3 exempts houses where only one
patient is kept, from license and inspection; they
should at any rate be registered, and some limited
power of visitation be allowed to prevent abuses; the
exemption may be construed at present into a license
for illegal imprisonment, provided the jailor can afford
a whole house to his victim.<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c011'><sup>[515]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The custody of pauper and criminal lunatics,<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c011'><sup>[516]</sup></a>
and the erection of asylums for their reception, is
provided for by <i>Statute</i> 48, <i>Geo.</i> 3, <i>c.</i> 96, and 59
<i>Geo.</i> 3, <i>c.</i> 127;<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c011'><sup>[517]</sup></a> but no provision has yet been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>made for lunatic debtors; when it is considered how
frequently the calamity of lunacy is induced by pecuniary
difficulty, it is not easy to account for this omission.
The observation of <i>Mr. Collinson</i> on this point
may be applied to more subjects than are at present
under our consideration.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>MEDICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL ILLUSTRATIONS OF INSANITY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As the duties of the Jurist and Physiologist in the
investigation of mental derangement are distinct in
their nature, if not different in their object, so shall
we find that the abstract terms used to denote the
form or degree of the malady have received from the
two professions a somewhat different latitude of acceptation.
For legal purposes the adoption of the
term “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non Compos Mentis</span></i>,” from the amplitude of
its construction, gets rid of those nicer distinctions
and difficulties which the pathologist is bound to encounter
and investigate; the lawyer only inquires
whether such a state of mind exists, as actually disqualifies
the person in question from conducting himself
with propriety, or managing his affairs; but the
medical evidence is bound not only to give his opinion
upon the case, but to state the reasons which
may have influenced his decision; and hence the necessity
of his becoming practically acquainted with
those physiological distinctions to which we have alluded.
It has been stated that there are two conditions
of the human mind, either of which very justly
deprives the subject of the control of his person and
property, and takes away from him all criminal responsibility,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>viz. <span class='sc'>Idiotcy</span>, (<i>Amentia</i>) or a total deficiency
of intellectual power; and <span class='sc'>Madness</span>, or a
morbid perversion of it. Between these two states
we shall not have much difficulty in discriminating;
the idiot cannot reason at all; the madman reasons
falsely; the idiot acts from animal appetency, he has
no will; the madman wills, but his reason being
disturbed, his actions are not compatible with the
usual relations of society.<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c011'><sup>[518]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Idiotcy may exist from birth,<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c011'><sup>[519]</sup></a> (<i>Amentia Congenita</i>
Cull. Syn. LXV, 1,) or it may be the effect of
Old Age, <i>Dotage</i> (<i>Amentia Senilis</i> Cull. Syn. LXV,
2,) or it may arise at any period of life from the operation
of various causes affecting the functions of the
brain, such as epileptic fits,<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c011'><sup>[520]</sup></a> intense study, intemperance,
the depressing passions, especially grief,
fevers, paralysis, and mania, (<i>Amentia acquisita</i> Cull.
Syn. LXV, 3.) In some cases fatuity is symptomatic
of another disease.</p>

<p class='c000'>The law, as we have already stated, makes an important
distinction between that species of idiotcy
which is congenital, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de nativitate</span></i>, and that which may
occur in after life; and upon this point, as well as
upon the extent of the malady, and the probability
of its cure, the medical practitioner may be called
upon to give an opinion. In cases of congenital
idiotcy there will not be much difficulty in pronouncing
judgment, for as it arises from malformation of
the cerebral organ, the prognosis must be adverse to
every hope of recovery; while the characteristic physiognomy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>of the unfortunate individual is generally
so striking as to enable the common observer
at once to ascertain the existence of idiotcy. The
vague expression of his countenance is commonly
associated with an awkwardness in the gait, which
would seem to depend upon a defect in the muscular
powers; there is, moreover, a degree of incontinence
with respect to the excretory discharges of his body;
and owing to a carelessness in not swallowing the saliva,
there is a constant drivelling from the mouth;
the speech is imperfect, and the extent of this deficiency
may, in general, be considered as a good indication
of the degree of fatuity, for it is necessary to
state, that all idiots are not of the same degree of
intellectual depravity; some possess more memory
than others, and display a talent for imitation; they
will whistle tunes correctly, and repeat passages from
books, which they have been taught by ear, but they
are incapable of comprehending what they repeat;
under such circumstances medical evidence may be
required for the purpose of obtaining an estimate of
the capacity of such an individual, and upon this subject
<i>Dr. Haslam</i><a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c011'><sup>[521]</sup></a> has offered the following judicious
remarks: “It has occurred to me, in many instances,
to be consulted concerning persons whose
minds have been naturally weak, or enfeebled by
disease, and it always appeared that by patient enquiry,
a satisfactory estimate of their capacity might
be instituted: the person exercising his judgment
upon this question ought particularly to ascertain the
power of the idiot’s attention; since his knowledge
of objects, and his memory of them, will depend on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>the duration of his attention; it will also be indispensably
necessary to investigate his comprehension of
numbers, without which the nature of property cannot
be understood; if a person were capable of enumerating
progressively to the number ten, and knew
the force and value of the separate units, he would
be fully competent to the management of property;
if he could comprehend that twice two composed four,
he could find no difficulty in understanding that
twice, or twain ten, constituted twenty. This <em>numeration</em>
also presumes he comprehended that so many
taken from ten, or subtracted, which is the converse,
would leave so many as the remainder. Without
such capacity, no man, in my own opinion, could
understand the nature of property, which is represented
by numbers of pounds, shillings, and pence.
The same imbecility of mind is often produced in
adults, and in those of advanced age, by paralytic or
epileptic attacks, and from various affections of the
brain, and requires the same accurate investigation
to determine on the competency of such persons to
be entrusted with the management of themselves and
affairs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In cases of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amentia acquisita</span></i>, our prognosis must
be directed by different circumstances: the faculties
of a person may only be in abeyance, and may revert
to a state of sanity, either spontaneously, or from
judicious treatment, or they may be only partially
affected.<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c011'><sup>[522]</sup></a> It however deserves notice that, in extent
of mortality, the most fatal of all the states of
mental disorder is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amentia acquisita</span></i>; it has been
computed that in the French hospitals a full moiety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>of the fatuous die; at the same time, it appears from
the reports of lunatic asylums, that this disorder is
sometimes cured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Idiots are, in general, harmless; their deportment
being characterised by a timidity that guards them
from any mischievous attempts, either upon themselves
or upon other persons; to this general rule,
however, exceptions not unfrequently occur; as, for
instance, in the unfortunate case of the idiot in Cornwall
who strangled, and afterwards burnt the body
of, an old woman who had for some years superintended
his person. In some cases of accidental fatuity,
a considerable disposition to obesity manifests
itself, and the subject becomes lethargic.</p>

<p class='c000'>Authors who have treated on the subject of <em>Insanity</em>
have anxiously attempted to frame a definition
of the malady; and, by compressing into a short
sentence its prominent and distinguishing phenomena,
to establish a fixed and essential character. In this
attempt each author has fundamentally differed, and
to enumerate their plans would be only to expose
their failures; the truth is, that the varied and mutable
phenomena of insanity will ever mock the grasp
of the nosologist; instead therefore of endeavouring
to discover an infallible definition, it will be of much
greater importance to investigate the circumstances
which should guide the medical witness in a decision
that may annul a man’s dominion over property,
involve his contracts and other acts which otherwise
would be binding, and take away his responsibility
for crimes. Modern authors, according to the system
of the Grecian writers, have generally divided
mental derangement into two <a id='class'></a>classes—<em>Mania</em><a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c011'><sup>[523]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span><em>Melancholia</em>;<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c011'><sup>[524]</sup></a> the former being distinguished by
a state of extraordinary excitement, the latter by
great depression; although they are frequently convertible
affections.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mania</em> may be said to be a state of mental alienation,
accompanied by an unusual ferocity in language
and deportment, and by a comparative insensibility
to ordinary stimuli.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Melancholia</em> is a form of insanity which is always
attended with some seemingly groundless, but very
anxious fear, by which the person is plunged into a
gloomy and desponding state, that not unfrequently
leads to the commission of suicide.</p>

<p class='c000'>The approaches of insanity have been as variously
described by different authors, as the characters by
which the malady itself is to be distinguished; indeed
the precursory symptoms of mania are extremely indefinite
and variable. <i>Dr. Haslam</i> observes, that
“the attack is almost imperceptible; some months
usually elapse before it becomes the subject of particular
notice, and fond relatives are frequently deceived
by the hope, that it is only an abatement of
excessive vivacity conducing to a prudent reserve and
steadiness of character; a degree of apparent thoughtfulness
and inactivity precedes, together with a diminution
of the ordinary curiosity concerning that
which is passing before them; and they therefore
neglect those objects and pursuits which formerly
proved sources of delight and instruction; the sensibility
appears to be considerably blunted; they do not
bear the same affection towards their parents and relations;
they become unfeeling to kindness, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>careless of reproof; if they read a book, they are
unable to give any account of its contents; sometimes,
with stedfast eyes, they will dwell for an hour
on one page, and then turn over a number in a few minutes;
their sleep is disturbed, and they awake in the
morning in a state of great disquietude and anxiety; as
the malady becomes farther developed, the symptoms
are less equivocal, the unhappy objects become loquacious
and disposed to harangue, and decide promptly
and positively upon every subject that may be started;
soon after, they are divested of all restraint in the
declaration of their opinions of those with whom they
are acquainted; their friendships are expressed with
fervency and extravagance, their enmities with intolerance
and disgust. They now become impatient of
contradiction, and scorn reproof; for supposed injuries
they are inclined to quarrel and fight with those
about them; at length suspicion creeps upon the
mind, they are aware of plots which had never been
contrived, and detect motives that were never entertained.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This picture, however, must be only regarded as
displaying the ordinary occurrences which precede
the attack; its approaches are sometimes distinguished
by a very different train of symptoms; the late <i>Dr.
John Monro</i><a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c011'><sup>[525]</sup></a> has remarked that “high spirits, as
they are generally termed, are the first symptoms of
this kind of disorder; these excite a man to take a
larger quantity of wine than usual; and the person
thus affected, from being abstemious, reserved, and
modest, shall become quite the contrary; drink
freely, talk boldly, obscenely, swear, sit up till
midnight, sleep little, rise suddenly from bed, go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>out a hunting, return again immediately, set all his
servants to work, and employ five times the number
that is necessary; in short, every thing he says or
does betrays the most violent agitation of mind, which
it is not in his power to correct; and yet, in the
midst of all this hurry, he will not misplace one word,
or give the least reason for any one to think he <em>imagines</em>
things to exist that really do not, or that they
appear to him different from what they do to other
people. They who see him but seldom, admire his
vivacity, are pleased with his sallies of wit, and the
sagacity of his remarks; nay, his own family are
with difficulty persuaded to take proper care of him,
until it becomes absolutely necessary, from the apparent
ruin of his health and fortune.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The patient under the influence of the depressing
passions will exhibit a train of symptoms altogether
different; the countenance wears an anxious and
gloomy aspect, he is little disposed to speak, he retires
from the company of those with whom he formerly
associated, secludes himself in obscure places,
or lies in bed the greater part of his time; frequently
he will keep his eyes fixed on some object for hours
together, or continue them an equal time ‘bent on
vacuity;’ he next becomes fearful, and conceives a
thousand fancies, often recurs to some immoral act
which he has committed, or imagines himself guilty
of crimes which he never perpetrated; believes that
God has abandoned him, and with trembling awaits
his punishment;<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c011'><sup>[526]</sup></a> frequently he becomes desperate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>and endeavours by his own hands to terminate an
existence which appears to be an afflicting and hateful
incumbrance.<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c011'><sup>[527]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The approaches of Insanity, are, however, not
always slow and progressive: the unhappy victim is
sometimes seized without any warning, and where
crimes have been perpetrated under such circumstances,
it becomes extremely embarrassing both to
the judgment of the physician and to the decision of
the court; each case, however, must rest upon its
own particular merits duly to be weighed and considered
both by the judge and jury, lest, to use the
expressions of <i>Sir Matthew Hale</i>, “there be on the
one side a kind of inhumanity towards the defects of
human nature, or, on the other side too great an indulgence
given to great crimes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Before we proceed to consider the several questions
which may arise for the consideration of the medical
witness, in the discharge of his forensic duties, we
shall offer a few observations upon a point which has
frequently given rise to discussion—Whether the
existence of insanity cannot be equally, or in some
cases, more satisfactorily established, or disproved,
by witnesses who are not of the medical profession?
by persons, for instance, who have had opportunities
of observing the individual, where the same advantages
have not been in the power of the practitioner.
To this we may reply, that the opinions of the generality
of persons on the subject of insanity are extremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>vague, and frequently very erroneous,<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c011'><sup>[528]</sup></a>
and are commonly the result of those glaring exhibitions,
those caricatures of disease which the stage represents,
or romances propagate; the ordinary observer
can hardly be convinced of the existence of
insanity, without some turbulent expression, extravagant
gesture, or phantastic decoration; while on
the other hand he is too apt to infer a state of insanity
from those whims and eccentric habits between which
the medical practitioner, from daily communication
with deranged persons, can alone know how to discriminate;
thus was <i>Democritus</i> accused by the people
of insanity, but when <i>Hippocrates</i>, by public request,
had a conference with the philosopher, he declared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>that not <i>Democritus</i>, but his enemies were insane.
There is moreover a class of maniacs who are so cunning
as to deceive those who are not acquainted with
the peculiar hallucinations under which they labour;
<i>Lord Erskine</i> was thus unable to detect the insanity
of a lunatic who fancied himself to be Jesus Christ,
until he had received the medical assistance which
the presence of <i>Dr. Sims</i> afforded him.<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c011'><sup>[529]</sup></a> It is unnecessary
to urge any farther the necessity of medical
testimony upon such occasions, we shall therefore
proceed to consider the different points to which it
will be more usefully directed.</p>

<p class='c019'>Q. 1. Whether the person be actually insane?
and what are the proofs of his derangement?</p>
<p class='c019'>Q. 2. Whether the symptoms are of such a nature
as to suffer the individual, with propriety,
to retain his liberty, and enjoy his
property?</p>
<p class='c019'>Q. 3. Whether there has been any lucid interval,
and of what duration?</p>
<p class='c019'>Q. 4. Whether there is a probable chance of
recovery; and in case of convalescence,
whether the cure is likely to be permanent?</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Q. 1. <i>Whether the person be actually insane—and if so, what are the proofs of his derangement?</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>It has been very justly observed, that to constitute
insanity it is not necessary to exhibit the ferocity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>a wild beast, nor to perform the antics of a buffoon;
the most ordinary observer can tell when a person is
furiously mad,<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c011'><sup>[530]</sup></a> but, in many cases, “<em>such thin
partitions do the hounds divide</em>,” that all the skill and
discernment of a medical practitioner is required to
establish the fact of insanity. It is to such cases
as are more likely to become subjects of legal investigation,
that the following observations particularly
apply. <i>Sir Matthew Hale</i> says, “there is a <em>partial</em>
insanity, and a <em>total</em> insanity; the former is either
in respect to things, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quoad hoc vel illud insanine</span></i>, where
persons are perfectly rational, except on some one
particular subject.” This fact is universally admitted,
constituting a form of mental alienation to which <i>M.
Esquirol</i><a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c011'><sup>[531]</sup></a> has bestowed the name of <i>Monomania</i>,
and of which every work on insanity abounds with
examples. It is in such cases that the value of medical
sagacity and experience becomes apparent, and
the full developement of the real state of the patient’s
mind and opinions will, in some instances, require
considerable time and patience. “It is nearly impossible,”
says <i>Dr. Haslam</i>, “to give any specific
directions for conducting such an examination as shall
inevitably disclose the delusions existing in the mind
of a crafty lunatic; but in my own opinion it is always
to be accomplished, provided sufficient time be allowed,
and the examiner be not interrupted. It is
not to be effected by directly selecting the subjects of
his delusion, for he will immediately perceive the
drift of such enquiries, and endeavour to evade, or
pretend to disown them; the purpose is more effectually
answered by leading him to the origin of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>distemper and tracing down the consecutive series of
his actions and association of ideas; <em>in going over the
road where he has stumbled, he will infallibly trip
again</em>.” There is, says <i>Dr. Male</i>,<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c011'><sup>[532]</sup></a> a madness
which shews itself in words, and another in actions;
a lunatic may be coherent in conversation, but insane
in conduct; he may be rational when under the restraint
of a mad-house, but when released, and at
liberty to act according to the impulse of his hallucination,
will shew by his conduct that he is really
insane.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although it cannot be difficult to form a diagnosis
between the ebullitions of passion, the extravagance
of intoxication, or the delirium of fever, and the
violence of deportment arising from insanity, yet it
may in some cases be not easy to discriminate between
this latter condition and that which is associated with
excessive enthusiasm; nor is it always easy to discriminate
between eccentricity and insanity; do we not,
says <i>Dr. Male</i>, see a wretch disinherit his own children,
who have committed no fault, and <a id='bestow'></a>bestow his
wealth upon a stranger? another who prefers poverty
and rags, and communion with vagabonds, to the
social intercourse and proffered kindness of his friends
and relations? yet who shall pronounce them to be
insane? that they are so, there can be no doubt,
and their disease is perhaps of the most unfortunate
character, for all their other actions being consistent
with sound reason, it is difficult to convince a jury of
their insanity, and to divest them of the power of
heaping ruin upon their families, and disgrace upon
themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bodily marks which distinguish the insane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>are, a peculiar cast of countenance, familiar to those
versed in the malady; a quick, oftentimes protruded
and glistening eye; the body is generally costive; in
some cases the insane person is enabled to sustain
cold with impunity, and he is insensible to the
agency of ordinary stimuli; and the stomach and
bowels, from deficiency of irritability, require large
doses of medicine to move them; among the physical
phenomena of insanity, <i>M. Esquirol</i> observes that few
are more constant or remarkable than want of sleep,
and that peculiarly disagreeable odour from the body,
as well as the excretions of the patients, which impregnates
the clothes and bedding. They are devoured
with a burning internal heat; and generally
have a voracious appetite, and are afflicted with pain
in some organ or part, especially the head, the chest,
or the abdomen, which the unhappy sufferers are
ready to attribute to the malevolence of their enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>In deciding upon that species of insanity which is
termed <i>Melancholia</i>, we must be cautious in not confounding
its symptoms with those of <i>Hypochondriasis</i>,
which is to be regarded as strictly a bodily malady;
the following remarks of <i>Dr. Cullen</i> may tend to
direct our judgment upon this interesting subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hypochondriasis I would consider as being always
attended with dyspeptic symptoms; and though there
may be, at the same time, an anxious melancholic
fear, arising from these symptoms, yet while this fear
is only a mistaken judgment with respect to the state
of the person’s own health, and to the danger to be
from thence apprehended, I would still consider the
disease as hypochondriasis, and as distinct from the
proper melancholia. But when an anxious fear and
despondency arise from a mistaken judgment with
respect to other circumstances than those of health,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>and more especially when the person is at the same
time without any dyspeptic symptoms, every one will
readily allow this to be a disease widely different
from both dyspepsia and hypochondriasis.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the phantoms<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c011'><sup>[533]</sup></a> which occasionally
appear to the hypochondriac, and are described
by him as having all the semblance of reality, <i>Dr.
Haslam</i> remarks, that although a person may labour
under a delusion, by seeing and hearing those things
which do not exist, yet if his belief in their reality
is not subscribed, but, on the contrary, he knows
them to be delusions,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A false creation, proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>and he is persuaded that his perception is beguiled,
no inference in favour of the existence of insanity
ought to be deduced; if, however, he should believe
in their reality, and commit an act in consequence
of such a conviction, he may be justly considered
insane—<em>it is the belief that, physiologically,
constitutes the disorder</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Q. 2. <i>Whether the symptoms are of such a nature as to suffer the individual, with propriety, to retain his liberty, and enjoy his property?</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>We have already offered some observations upon
this point, (<i>page</i> <a href='#Page_302'>302</a>); the medical practitioner in
delivering an opinion that may involve the liberty of
the person, cannot well be too guarded in his evidence.
As each case must rest upon its own merits, the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>scarcely admits of any general elucidation beyond
that which we have already endeavoured to bestow,
and the plan of our work must of necessity
preclude the more minute details. We must, however,
here observe, that coercion should never be
employed but as a protecting restraint—to guard the
patient from doing mischief to himself, or offering
violence to others; and for this purpose the straight-waistcoat
is generally sufficient: formerly, coercion
was employed with a degree of severity that amounted
to vindictive punishment, recourse was even had to
the whip, and stripes were actually inflicted by medical
direction; while asylums for the reception of the
insane, were considered as prisons for safe custody
and punishment, rather than as hospitals for the
treatment and cure of this most dreadful malady.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>Q. 3. <i>Whether there has been any lucid interval, and of what duration?</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>This is a question which a medical witness is always
called upon to answer. By the term <em>lucid interval</em>,
we are not to understand a <em>remission</em> of the malady,
but a total suspension of it—a complete, although
only a temporary, restoration of reason. The question
is generally beset with difficulties, and requires
all the penetration and experience of the physician
to arrive at a safe conclusion; for in many cases the
patient is enabled for a limited period to converse
rationally, and where he is desirous of carrying any
particular plan into execution, to dissemble so completely
as to impose with success upon his attendants;
of which the following case, related by Dr. <i>Haslam</i>,<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c011'><sup>[534]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>may serve as an excellent illustration. “A
lunatic having received, or fancied he had received,
an injury from his keeper, at the lunatic asylum at
Manchester, threatened to be revenged, for which
he was punished by confinement; he was afterwards
a patient in Bethlem hospital, and gave <i>Dr. Haslam</i>
an account of the transaction, of which the following
is an abbreviation. ‘Not liking this situation, I was
induced to play the hypocrite; I pretended extreme
sorrow for having threatened him, and, by an affectation
of repentance, induced him to release me; for
several days I paid him great attention, and lent him
every assistance; he seemed much pleased with the
flattery, and became very friendly in his behaviour
towards me; going one day into the kitchen, where
his wife was busied, I saw a knife; this was too
great a temptation to be resisted; I concealed it, and
carried it about with me; for some time afterwards
the same friendly intercourse was maintained between
us, but as he was one day unlocking his garden door,
I seized the opportunity and plunged this knife, up
to the hilt, in his back.’” There is a species of insanity
which has been called <em>intermittent</em>, in which the
patient is perfectly rational for a considerable interval;
the malady often recurs two or three times in a
year, and lasts several weeks, the subject of the hallucination
being always the same.<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c011'><sup>[535]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c010'>Q. 4. <i>Whether there is a probable chance of recovery; and in case of convalescence, whether the cure is likely to be permanent?</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>The <em>prognosis</em>, or means of ascertaining the probable
event of mental derangement, is founded on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>the consideration of many different circumstances,
such as the particular modification of the malady;
the violence of the symptoms; the duration and frequency
of the attack; its causes; the age, sex, constitutional
temperament, and hereditary dispositions
of the affected individual; the general state of his
health; and the particular nature of his bodily maladies;
upon each of which we shall offer a few observations.<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c011'><sup>[536]</sup></a>
It has been remarked that those affected
with furious mania recover in a larger proportion than
those who suffer under the depressing influence of
melancholy, but that when the maniacal and melancholic
states alternate, the hope of recovery is farther
diminished. The probability of cure is also more or
less, according to the duration of the disease; when,
however, it has acquired a systematic character, it
becomes very difficult to remove it, so that after it has
continued upwards of a year, patients at public asylums,
as in Bethlem and Saint Luke’s, are pronounced
incurable, and treated accordingly. In considering
the causes of mania, we must class them in
two divisions—<em>Predisposing</em>, and <em>Exciting</em>. Among
the former of these causes stand <em>hereditary predisposition</em>;
<em>injuries of the brain</em>; (these also belong to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>class of exciting causes); <em>certain bodily diseases</em>; and
a <em>peculiar temperament</em>. Among the latter we may
first enumerate those of a <span class='sc'>Physical</span> nature, as <em>frequent
intoxication</em>; <em>fever</em>; <em>mercurial medicines</em>, largely
administered; <em>the suppression of periodical or occasional
discharges and secretions</em>; <em>parturition</em>; <em>injuries
to the head from external violence</em>, <i>&amp;c.</i> The <span class='sc'>Moral</span>
causes include those emotions which are conceived to
originate from the mind itself, and which, from their
excess, tend to distort the natural feelings; or, from
their repeated accessions, and unrestrained indulgence,
at length overthrow the barriers of reason
and established opinion; such are the <em>gusts of violent
passion</em>, and the <em>protracted indulgence of grief</em>; the
<em>terror</em> impressed by erroneous views of religion; the
<em>degradation of pride</em>; <em>disappointment in love</em>; and
<em>sudden fright</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of Hereditary disposition we may observe, that
there does not appear to be any malady more obviously
dependant upon its influence than that of madness<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c011'><sup>[537]</sup></a>;
for even if one generation escape, the taint
is presumed to cling to the succeeding branches until,
either by admixture with a purer stock, or by education
or management, it is neutralized or drained
away. In forming a prognosis it therefore becomes
the first object of inquiry, whether any branch of the
patient’s family has ever manifested any symptoms of
the disease; for where this is made out, our expectations
of permanent recovery must be slender; and
even should the patient become convalescent, he will
be liable to a relapse from every fresh exposure to
the exciting causes. Injuries about the head may be
considered as both the predisposing and exciting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>causes of insanity; for a fracture of the cranium has
been known to produce disorder in persons who had
never betrayed the least obliquity previous to the accident,
and whose families had never manifested the
slightest disposition to the malady. Although mental
derangement has been observed in persons of every
habit and temperament, yet there is certainly a complexion
which may be said to predominate in these
cases; <i>Dr. Haslam</i>, for instance, has stated, that
out of 265 patients in Bethlem hospital, 205 were
found to be of a swarthy complexion, with dark or
black hair; the remaining 60 having a fair skin, and
light brown or red hair. Among the most powerful
exciting causes of derangement of intellect in those
predisposed to the malady are to be classed the
moral causes which produce mental distress and uneasiness;
at the eventful era of the French revolution,
and for some years after, the lunatic establishments
of France were inundated by its victims; and
<i>Dr. Burrows</i> observes, that the annals of insanity
will satisfactorily shew that there never was, in any
country, a sudden increment of insane persons, without
some powerful and evident excitation, physical,
moral, theological, or political.<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c011'><sup>[538]</sup></a> I have, says <i>Zimmerman</i>,<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c011'><sup>[539]</sup></a>
had occasion to see all the great hospitals
in Paris, and have distinguished in them three kinds
of maniacs: the men who had become so through
pride; the girls through love; and the women
through jealousy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The use of ardent spirits or wine to a person predisposed
to insanity, is always dangerous; under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>same circumstances a long course of mercurial remedies
has been found mischievous. The suppression
of accustomed evacuations is also a frequent cause of
mania, and the restoration of them not unfrequently
removes the mental affection. Where there is in women
an hereditary disposition to mania, it is frequently
called into action immediately after parturition; in
such cases, the prognosis is favourable;<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c011'><sup>[540]</sup></a> on the
other hand, it has been remarked that in our climate,
women are more frequently affected with insanity
than men; and it has been considered very unfavourable
to recovery, if they should be worse at the period
of menstruation, or have their catamenia in very
small or immoderate quantities. We have already
noticed local injuries of the head among the predisposing
causes; we may also observe in this place,
that they not unfrequently prove an exciting one; in
the case of <i>Hadfield</i> the insanity was occasioned by a
blow on the skull. <span class='sc'>Dissection</span> has thrown little or
no light on the pathology of insanity; it must be
admitted that a peculiar structure of the brain will
predispose to madness, but there may exist many alterations
in the structure of these parts too minute
for the eye to observe, or the scalpel to expose. In
some cases, however, the brain of the maniac displays
an obvious deviation from the healthy appearances,
as we learn from the testimonies of <i>Chiarugi</i> in Italy,
<i>Greding</i> in Germany, and from <i>Dr. Haslam’s</i> work
in this country. The more general appearances
would seem to consist in excessive determination of
blood to the brain, with enlargement of its vessels;
and effusion of fluids into its cavities; the membranes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>of the brain have also been found variously altered
from their healthy state; ossifications have been observed
on the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dura mater</span></i>; the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tunica arachnoidea</span></i> has
appeared thickened, and more or less opaque; and
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pia mater</span></i> has not unfrequently appeared inflamed
and turgid with blood; besides which <i>Dr. Haslam</i>
has recorded an appearance of air in the vessels of
this membrane; nor is it uncommon to discover effusions
of a watery fluid between these membranes.
The medullary substance, when cut into, has seemed
to contain more blood than usual; the consistence of
the branular mass has moreover been stated, by different
anatomists, to recede from its natural state in
cases of insanity. <i>Bonetus</i>, in his <cite>Sepulchret. Anatom.</cite>
has asserted that the brain of maniacs is so dry
and friable that it may almost be rubbed into powder;
but with respect to this we are disposed to
doubt. <i>Morgagni</i>,<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c011'><sup>[541]</sup></a> however, tells us that he has
generally found the brain of such persons of considerable
hardness; and <i>Mr. John Hunter</i> has
found it so tough as even to exhibit some degree of
elasticity; <i>Dr. Baillie</i> has also remarked, that when
these changes take place in the brain, the mind is at
the same time deranged, there being either mania, or
lethargy, or the person is much subject to convulsive
paroxysms. Other cases might be adduced in which
the brain was found on dissection to have a consistence
preternaturally soft. With regard to these
phenomena, the experienced anatomist will readily
coincide with <i>Pinel</i>, that although they may occur in
the brain of the maniac, yet that they have frequently
been found where no mental affection had ever betrayed
itself; in addition to which we may remark that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>it does not necessarily follow that the morbid appearances
disclosed by dissection had existed during the
progress of the malady; it has been very truly observed
by an intelligent reviewer,<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c011'><sup>[542]</sup></a> that a person
may have, for ten years, frequent attacks of epilepsy;
he may become at last maniacal, and die comatose.
Upon dissection, marks of inflammation and of serous
effusion are observed in the brain and its membranes;
but can we suppose that any such lesion of structure
existed during even the latter half of the epileptic
state?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>OF NUISANCES, LEGALLY, MEDICALLY, AND CHEMICALLY CONSIDERED.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>There are in law many kinds of nuisance; but we
shall confine ourselves to the consideration of those
only which can be made the subject of medical or
chemical investigation; these are such as are directly
or indirectly detrimental to health, whether general
or individual; or are destructive to comfort; or injurious
to property: obstructions to the free course
of air, light, and water, volumes of smoke, and
noisome smells fall under the two first descriptions,
while the fumes of some manufactures combine every
species of annoyance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question, how far the salubrity of the atmosphere
may be affected by the effluvia of particular
manufactories, is one that the medical practitioner is
often called upon to decide; and upon such an occasion
let him beware that his judgment be not
swayed by the fastidiousness of the surrounding inhabitants,
nor warped by the clamours of invidious rivals
or interested opponents; as a man of science and
integrity he is called upon to decide between two parties
equally valuable to the state,—between the
health and comfort of the citizen, and the prosperity
of the manufacturer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The manufactories and occupations which have
been considered exceptionable, for reasons to be
hereafter enumerated, may be arranged under four
divisions, viz.</p>

<p class='c019'>1. <i>Those, during whose operation gaseous effluvia, the
products of</i> <span class='sc'>Putrefaction</span> <i>or</i> <span class='sc'>Fermentation</span>,
<i>escape into the atmosphere, and are either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>noxious from their effects upon animals, or insufferable
from the noisomeness of their smell</i>:
such as the steeping of flax, and hemp; (1) the
manufacture of catgut; slaughter-houses; starch
manufactories (2); tanneries (3); the feeding
of swine; and the several occupations of horse
slaughterers (4); skinners; fell-mongers; curriers,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class='c019'>II. <i>Those, where, by the</i> <span class='sc'>Action of Fire</span>, <i>various
principles are evolved, and diffused in the form
of vapour, or gas; the inhalation of which is
not only disagreeable to the senses, but injurious
to the health</i>; as the process of brewing (5);
the formation of various acids (6); the incineration
of animal substances, as practised by the
manufacturers of hartshorn; Prussian blue (7)
makers; roasters of horn for lanthorns (8);
glue manufacturers; varnish makers (9); soap
boilers(10), and renderers of tallow (11); smelting
houses (12); gasworks; brick kilns; turpentine
distillers, and rosin makers, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class='c019'>III. <i>Those, which are capable of yielding waste
liquids, that poison the neighbouring springs
and streams</i>, as gas works (13); starch manufactories;
dying-houses, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class='c019'>IV. <i>Those trades, whose pursuit is necessarily accompanied
with great noises</i>, as those of copper-smiths;
anchor-makers; gold-beaters; tin-men;
trunk-makers; proof-houses, (where
cannons are proved); the tilting of steel;
forging bar iron; flatting-mills;<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c011'><sup>[543]</sup></a> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>Against these nuisances there are various remedies:
by action or indictment at law, by injunction in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>equity, and sometimes by the summary abatement of
the party injured.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>If the injury be general (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad commune nocumentum
omnium ligeorum</span></i>) the proper remedy is by indictment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>1 <i>Inst.</i> 56, 3 <i>Bl. Com.</i> 219, 4 <i>Bl. Com.</i> 167;
and an indictment will lie even though there be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>another remedy or punishment by act of parliament,
as for keeping swine in London, 2 <i>Will. and Ma. Sess.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>2, <i>c.</i> 8, § 20; <i>Regina v. Wigg</i>; 2 <i>Salk.</i> 460; <i>Ld.
Raym.</i> 1163. But it is otherwise of an <em>offence created</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>by statute, then the remedy must be in the form prescribed
by the statute.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>Though indictment is a suit of the crown, and a
general pardon will excuse the fine inflicted on conviction
for a nuisance, it will not prevent the abatement
of it. <i>Rex et Regina</i> v. <i>Wilcox</i>, 2 <i>Salk.</i> 458;
see also <i>Dewell</i> v. <i>Sanders</i>, cited 16 <i>Vin. Abr.</i> 42, 45.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if the nuisance be not general, but particular,
then an indictment will not lie; yet the individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>aggrieved may have his action on the case, 3 <i>Bl. Com.</i>
220; <i>Bull. N.P.</i> 26; <i>Esp. N.P.</i> 635. Individuals
also are in some cases permitted of themselves to
abate a nuisance, 3 <i>Bl. Com.</i> 5; <i>Lodie</i> v. <i>Arnold</i>;
2 <i>Salk.</i> 458; 16 <i>Vin.</i> 40. In <i>Rex</i> v. <i>Rosewell</i>, only
a small fine was set upon the defendant convicted on
indictment of a riot, committed while pulling down
some part of a house, it being a nuisance to his lights;
see case 2 <i>Salk.</i> 459, and authorities there cited; also
<i>Rosewell</i> v. <i>Prior</i>, <i>ib.</i> 460; but contra, see cases
where they may not; <i>Lord Mansfield’s</i> judgment in
<i>Cooper</i> v. <i>Marshall</i>, 1 <i>Bur.</i> 259.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old writs, the assize of nuisance, F. N. B. 183,
and <i>Quod permittat prosternare</i>, F. N. B. 124, <i>Palmer</i>
v. <i>Poultney</i>, 2 <i>Salk.</i> 458, are now out of use, but
might be resorted to on an extreme occasion, 3 <i>Bl.
Com.</i> 220.</p>

<p class='c000'>Courts of Equity will also interpose by injunction
in cases of nuisance, to restrain and prevent an injury
for which courts of law, in many cases, could
not give an adequate compensation, 1 <i>Fonb. Tr. Eq.</i>
31; <i>Coulson</i> v. <i>White</i>; 3 <i>Atk.</i> 21; <i>Atty. Gen.</i> v.
<i>Doughty</i>, 2 <i>Ves.</i> 453. And though the Court of
Chancery, on application to have an assumed nuisance
(as a mill-dam which had been destroyed) restored
to its original state, has refused an injunction;
yet to accelerate the determination of the right it has
directed the defendant to bring an action of trespass,
and every thing to be admitted on both sides necessary
for trying the mere right. <i>Birch</i> v. <i>Sir Lyster
Holt</i>; 3 <i>Atk.</i> 725; 2 <i>Ves.</i> 414; on this principle see
also <i>Lord Teynham</i> v. <i>Herbert</i>, 2 <i>Atk.</i> 483, and
cases there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Noxious, dangerous, or highly disagreeable trades
and manufactures are nuisances, except when exercised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>in accustomed places;<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c011'><sup>[546]</sup></a> thus an ancient brewery<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c011'><sup>[547]</sup></a>
though in the midst of a populous town, is no
actionable nuisance, 2 <i>Lil. Abr.</i> 246; <i>Jones</i> v. <i>Powell;
Palm.</i> 536; <i>Hutt.</i> 153; because it shall be supposed
to have been erected when there were no buildings
near; but if a brewery or glass-house (<i>Rex et
Regina</i> v. <i>Wilcox</i>, 2 <i>Salk.</i> 458) be newly erected, it
is a nuisance, 1 <i>Hawk. Pl.</i> 199; <i>Jones</i> v. <i>Powell</i>,
<i>Hutton</i> 135, for the smoke is at least destructive of
comfort and may be injurious to health; much more
then is a smelting-house a nuisance when, in addition
to dense and continued volumes of smoke,
the poisonous fumes of sulphur, lead, antimony,
and arsenic, not only taint the atmosphere, but so
affect vegetation as either to destroy it altogether
or poison the cattle that feed upon the adjacent
herbage; or where the vapours injure fruit trees, 4
<i>Ed.</i> 3, and 4 <i>as. pla.</i> 3, cited in a pamphlet A. D.
1639 in Serjeant <i>Hill’s</i> collection of law pamphlets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>vol. 5; see also 1 <i>Roll. Abr.</i> 89; 1 <i>Burr. R.</i> 260.
Now though the business of smelting is highly necessary,
and it may appear hard to restrain a man from
making the most profitable use of his lands and premises,
yet public health is of primary importance,<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c011'><sup>[548]</sup></a>
and these maxims of law must ever be remembered:
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prohibetur ne quis faciat in suo, quod nocere possit
alieno: et sic utere tuo ut alienum non lædas. Palm.</span></i>
536; 9 <i>Co. Rep.</i> 58.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>Next to the fumes of metallic poisons we may rank
the vapours of sulphuric, nitric, muriatic, and other
acids, when carelessly prepared in large quantities,
<i>Rex</i> v. <i>White and Ward, Burr.</i> 333.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>It was said to be no nuisance to a neighbourhood
for a butcher or chandler (<i>Rankett’s</i> case) to set up
their trades among them; but it may be by such or
other tradesmen (as a dyer, <i>Hutt.</i> 136) laying stinking
heaps at their doors; in other cases the necessity
of the thing shall dispense with the noisomeness of
it.<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c011'><sup>[549]</sup></a> <cite>Jacobs’ Law Dict. tit.</cite> Nuisance; 2 <i>Rolle’s
Abr.</i> 139. But query, how the necessity is to be
proved? for though the sale of meat and candles be
necessary in a town, the one need not be slaughtered,
nor the other manufactured among ordinary dwelling
houses; the one is offensive to the feelings of humanity
and disgusting to the senses, the other is so disagreeable
to the olfactory nerves, that few persons
can pass a tallow-chandlers on a melting-day without
experiencing some degree of nausea.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all the best regulated cities of Europe the
slaughter-houses are confined to particular situations,
generally without the walls;<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c011'><sup>[550]</sup></a> the general neatness
and propriety of English towns leave little to be derived
from foreign example, but in this instance we are
defective. Some years since, a pamphlet was published
against the nuisance of street butchers, but evidently
without effect; perhaps the mere vending of meat in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>open shops may not be attended with any evil sufficient
to counter-balance the convenience; but where
the beasts are also slaughtered in ordinary situations,
the nuisance is very considerable, and in many instances
likely to be injurious to the health of the
neighbourhood; for though the nuisance is not so
apparent in some of the streets as before the act of
the <i>57th Geo.</i> 3,<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c011'><sup>[551]</sup></a> yet the accumulation of filth behind
the houses is likely to be the greater from the very
circumstance of its being remote from public observation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though in making these observations we recommend
general markets, and selected situations, for the
exercise of particular trades, rather than that they
should be dispersed throughout the town; yet we
must observe, that unless these districts are made the
subject of peculiar regulation, the public evil might
be encreased in intensity by accumulation, much more
than it had been diminished by segregation. In places
for the sale of animal food cleanliness is very generally
attended to, as a contrary practice would greatly increase
the tendency to putrefaction; self-interest is
here the best possible guard against nuisance, but this
motive does not so immediately apply to other cases,<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c011'><sup>[552]</sup></a>
and we accordingly occasionally observe the utmost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>disregard of public convenience in the conduct
of many disgusting manufactures.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dictum of <i>Rolle</i> that usefulness shall dispense
with noisomness has, however, been broken in upon
by many more modern decisions; in <i>Morley</i> v. <i>Pragnel,
Cro. Car.</i> 510, an innkeeper brought an action
against the defendant for erecting a tallow-furnace so
near his inn that many of his guests left the house,
and he recovered damages for the injury; <i>Tohayle’s</i>
case was then quoted; he had erected a tallow-furnace
in the Strand, which, on indictment, was ordered
to be abated, (see also 1 <i>Hawk. P. C.</i> 463
where <i>Rolle’s</i> doctrine is questioned.)</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the physical effect of each particular species
of bad smell, there may always be some doubt, and
much contrariety of evidence is to be expected; this
however is certain, that those stenches which may be
innocuous to persons in full health, are by no means
so to invalids or persons of irritable nerves or stomachs;
and to pregnant women they are generally
allowed to be dangerous.<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c011'><sup>[553]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>Habit has also a powerful operation in diminishing
the deleterious effects of such effluvia; instances
daily occur in which the fumes of certain manufactories
affect strangers in the most violent degree, while
the artisans engaged in the occupations which produce
them; or the persons accustomed from their
residence to the full force of their influence, scarcely
experience any inconvenience; nay, in some cases,
they would even seem to derive a degree of benefit
from such an atmosphere, and to suffer whenever
they quitted it;<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c011'><sup>[554]</sup></a> like the criminal recorded by
Sanctorius, who fell sick when taken out of an infected
dungeon, and did not recover until he had been
returned into the impure air to which he had been so
long habituated. We apprehend that the history of
the French bastile would furnish the physiologist
with some extraordinary illustrations of the power
of habit over the functions of the body. We introduce
these remarks for the purpose of shewing, that
persons immediately engaged in an indictable manufactory,
are not only morally, but physically, incompetent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>to give evidence in proof of the extent of the
mischief it may create: in addition to which it must not
be forgotten, that in those works in which are carried
on the fusion and volatilization of metals, the workmen
employed in the interior of the building escape the deleterious
fumes which pass up the flues, and spread desolation
over the surrounding district. These views
will moreover enable us on many occasions to reconcile
the conflicting testimony which is so often given on
trials of nuisance, without in the least impeaching the
veracity or sincerity of the individual witnesses engaged
in the contest.</p>

<p class='c000'>But for the purposes of legal redress it is not necessary
that the smell should be unwholesome; it is
enough if it renders the enjoyment of life and property
uncomfortable: see <i>Lord Mansfield’s</i> judgment in <i>Rex</i>
v. <i>White and Ward</i>, 1 <i>Burr. R.</i> 333; so in <i>Aldred’s</i>
case, 9 <i>Co. Rep.</i> 57, which was for keeping hogs;
<i>Regina</i> v. <i>Wigg</i>, 2 <i>Salk.</i> 460, 2 <i>Lord Raym.</i> 1163.
In <i>Street</i> v. <i>Tugwell</i>, for keeping seven pointers close
to the plaintiff’s house, whereby he was annoyed by
the noise and smell, the jury found for the defendant;
and though <i>Lord Kenyon</i> would not grant a
new trial, he said another action might be brought
for the continuance. <i>Mic. Term</i>, 41 <i>Geo.</i> 3; 2 <i>Selw.
Ab.</i> 1006.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the obstruction<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c011'><sup>[555]</sup></a> of a fine prospect is no
nuisance (<i>Aldred’s</i> case, 9 <i>Pep.</i> 58; 3 <i>Salk.</i> 247, 459;
<i>Attorney Gen.</i> at the relation of <i>Gray’s Inn Society</i>
v. <i>Doughty</i>, 2 <i>Ves.</i> 453) yet as an action lies for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>hindering the wholesome air, 9 <i>Rep.</i> 58, query
whether building a house across the end of a street,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>whereby it becomes less wholesome, whether by want
of air or by stagnation of damp vapours, is or is not
a nuisance? and whether actionable or indictable.
For though the rule originally laid down as to indictable
nuisances is, that they must be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad commune
nocumentum omnium ligeorum</span></i>, yet if it be to the injury
of a great many, as to the inhabitants of a whole
street, that is enough; <i>Rex</i> v. <i>Roupel</i>; K. B. Kingston
Assizes, 59 <i>Geo.</i> 3; and <i>Sir Ed. Coke</i> says,
“there is a writ in the register necessary to be put
in execution for the wholesomeness of the air in
London, and all other cities.” <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De vicis et venellis
mutandis</span></i>, 4 <i>Inst.</i> 252.</p>

<p class='c000'>The abatement of those nuisances which affect the
atmosphere is of the highest importance, for it is not
optional what air we shall breathe; and next to them
we may rank those which affect running streams or
other waters.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lourlulary, or lourgary, is an offence when any
cast any corrupt thing appoisoning the waters in or
about <i>London</i>, compounded of these two words
<i>lour</i> corruption, and <i>laron</i> a thief or felon, and if
any die by reason of such offence within a year
after, it is felony; and extendeth to all other
cities.” Burgs. &amp;c. 4 <i>Inst.</i> 252; (see also 8 <i>Geo.</i>
1, <i>c.</i> 26, and several modern paving acts.) And by
an old statute 12 R. 2, <i>c.</i> 13, which if it be (as asserted)
obsolete, well deserves to be revived in some
form, none shall cast any garbage, dung, or filth,
into ditches, waters, or other places within or near
any city or town, on pain of punishment by the <i>Lord
Chancellor</i>!! at discretion!! as a nuisance. The jurisdiction
has been rather strangely given according
to modern notions, but the provision of the act appears
to be wise, and might even now be useful.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>To steep stinking sheep-skins (2 <i>Strange</i> 686) or
other noxious, noisome, or poisonous thing is indictable.
It is a nuisance, for which an action will
lie, to erect a lime-kiln<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c011'><sup>[556]</sup></a> so near a fish-pond that it
infects the water, and the fish die, or to make a drain
which brings in unwholesome food to them, 16 <i>Vin.
Abr.</i> 33;<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c011'><sup>[557]</sup></a> and if it be on a navigable river it is indictable,
as in the recent case of the <i>King</i> at the relation
of the city of <i>London</i>, conservators of the
<i>Thames</i> against <i>Munroe</i> and <i>Evans</i>, proprietors of
certain gass-works, the refuse from which being discharged
into the river is said to have destroyed the
fish;<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c011'><sup>[558]</sup></a> the defendants were found guilty. <i>Croydon
Assizes</i>, 1821.</p>

<p class='c000'>Noises, whether by day (<i>Tenant</i> v. <i>Jones</i> K. B.
Feb. 15, 1821) or by night (<i>Rex</i> v. <i>Smith</i>, 2 Str.
704) are nuisances, for these not only render life uncomfortable,
but are prejudicial to the health of invalids;
there is a case in equity where an agreement
not to toll a church-bell was enforced by injunction.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it is said the fears of mankind, however reasonable,
will not create a nuisance; therefore it is
no nuisance to erect a building for the purposes of
inoculation, (<i>Jac. Law Dict. Anon Dec.</i> 18, 1752;
3 <i>Atk.</i> 21, 720, 750.) In this case a motion was
made for an injunction to stay the building of a house
for the purpose of inoculating for the small-pox in
Cold Bath Fields; for the motion the following cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>and authorities were cited, 2 <i>Roll. Abr.</i> 139, (the
case of <i>Browne</i> for dividing a messuage) <i>Hawk. Pl.
c.</i> 75, <i>s.</i> 11; 1 <i>Lutw.</i> 169. But <i>Lord Hardwicke</i>
said, that upon an indictment of that kind there had
been lately an acquittal at Rye, and refused the injunction.</p>

<p class='c000'>This decision does not appear to be reconcileable
with the cases and statutes respecting the keeping of
gunpowder,<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c011'><sup>[559]</sup></a> which is a nuisance by the reasonable
fears of possible danger, (<i>Rex</i> v. <i>Taylor</i>, 2 <i>Str.</i> 1167,
1169.) So also it was a nuisance, indictable, to divide
a house in a town for poor people to inhabit in,
by reason whereof it will be more dangerous in the
time of sickness and infection of the plague, (2 <i>Roll.
Abr.</i> 139); and this possible evil has often been
realised in the obscurer parts of <i>London</i> in cases of
typhus, and more frequently in the liberty of <i>Dublin</i>
where the narrowness of the streets, and the alleged
operation of the window-tax have excluded the possibility
of proper ventilation. It is therefore more
reasonable to suppose that the utility of the establishment
in question in the above cited case, and the
comparative openness of the situation prevailed over
the fear of possible risk, and that the principal objection
was the exercise of the summary jurisdiction of
a court of equity in a matter more properly triable at
law, rather than from an opinion that a receptacle
for highly infectious diseases in a populous neighbourhood
was not a nuisance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>But if the disorders for which it is open be not
highly infectious, an hospital is certainly no nuisance.
In the case of <i>Rex</i> v. <i>Mac Donald</i>, 3 <i>Burr.
L.</i> 1645, it was moved that an indictment against the
defendant, for converting his house into an hospital
for taking in and delivering lewd, idle, and disorderly
unmarried women, should be quashed; <i>Lord
Mansfield</i> took notice of the narrow principles of the
prosecutors, (the parish, for that they were thereby
burthened with bastards) and expressed his surprise
how such a bill could ever be found, asking “by what
law is it criminal to deliver a woman when she is
with child.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether a new comer can have an action for a nuisance
has been doubted, for it was his own act that
he came into the neighbourhood, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">volenti non fit
injuria</span></i>; but on the other hand see <i>Westborn</i> v.
<i>Mordaunt, Cro. Eliz.</i> 191; 2 <i>Leon.</i> pl. 129, p. 103;
Espin. N. P. 637; and if a man come into possession
of the premises by descent, or operation of law, or a
clergyman to his parsonage, it would appear that he
may at any rate have his action.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must be observed that every continuance of a
nuisance is held to be a fresh one, and therefore a
fresh action will lie; and very exemplary damages
will probably be given, if after one verdict against
him the defendant has the hardiness to continue it;
(<i>Westborn</i> v. <i>Mordaunt</i>, 2 <i>Leon. pl.</i> 121; <i>Beswick</i>
v. <i>Cunden Hill, Cro. Eliz.</i> 402; <i>Bull</i>, <i>N. P.</i> 75;
<i>Espin, N. P.</i> 637). And it is a continuance, though
the premises constituting the nuisance be let to an
under-tenant subsequently to the verdict against the
first tenant for years for the erection, for he transferred
it with the original wrong, and his demise
affirms the continuance of it; he hath also rent as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>consideration for the continuance, and therefore ought
to answer the damage it occasions. <i>Rosewell</i> v.
<i>Prior</i>, 2 <i>Salk.</i> 460, and cases there.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are other things which may be called nuisances
in transitu, such as the removal of night-soil,
garbage, soap boilers-lees, (the waste lees are the
residual liquor after soap-boiling), and other very
stinking refuse; all these should be restrained (as
some already are) to certain hours of the night.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>OF IMPOSITIONS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Under this head we shall comprehend the subject
of <em>Feigned Diseases</em>, and that of the <em>Adulterations of
Food</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Feigned</span>, or <span class='sc'>Simulated Diseases</span>.</h3>

<p class='c013'>There are several objects, for the accomplishment
of which persons are induced to simulate the existence
of disease; such as, for obtaining military exemptions
and discharges; or certain civil disqualifications;
for the purpose of deriving parochial relief,
or pecuniary assistance from benefit societies; or the
comfortable shelter and retreat of an hospital; for
exciting compassion and obtaining alms; for creating
public interest and curiosity; for procuring release
from confinement, or exemption from punishment;
and, lastly, for the dishonest intention of recovering
unjust compensation from some person selected for accusation,
as the author of the pretended calamity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The subject has been very ably treated by different
authors on Medical Jurisprudence, especially by <i>Mahon</i>
and <i>Foderé</i>, whose opportunities for observation
during the severe operation of the conscription laws,
must have been numerous and instructive; in our
own country the work of <i>Dr. Hennen</i>, on the principles
of Military Surgery, will be found to contain
some very valuable information upon the detection
of such impostures.</p>

<p class='c000'>The diseases which have been selected for the accomplishment
of any of the purposes above enumerated
are extremely numerous, although there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>some few which may be said to be more generally
preferred on such occasions.</p>

<p class='c000'>In general the medical enquirer will not have much
difficulty in detecting such impositions; although
there are cases where the investigation becomes a
subject of extreme delicacy and importance, as in
those of persons reporting themselves sick, and unfit
for military service, or <i>Malingerers</i>, as they are technically
called. It must be confessed that there is a
degree of <em>eclat</em> attending the detection of a fraud,
which is very likely to lead the practitioner astray,
by inducing him to attach undue importance to the
supposed proofs of guilt; such cases have unfortunately
occurred, and the innocence of the party has
been compromised by the vanity of the inquisitor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whenever the suspicions of a medical person are
excited with respect to the sincerity of a patient’s account,
he should always endeavour to conceal them;
he should become himself a dissembler, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">superare
malitiam malitia</span></i>,” for while the impostor is persuaded
that the medical attendant is his dupe, he will be less
on his guard; he should then be desired to describe
with minuteness every symptom and circumstance of
his malady; he should be questioned as to its origin,
progress, and duration, its seat, and intensity, and
the effects produced upon it by remedies; few impostors
will be able to withstand such interrogatories
without tripping; they will soon betray some incongruity
in their statements, and enable the pathologist
to elicit the truth. A girl of seventeen counterfeited
epilepsy so well in the general hospital of Montpellier,
as to elude all suspicion, until <i>M. de Sauvages</i>
who being less credulous asked her whether she had
not felt an air pass from the hand to the shoulder, and
from the shoulder to the thigh, when, upon her replying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>in the affirmative, he ordered her to be whipped,
after which she had never any return of the disease.
If a patient complains of a long protracted disease,
which has rendered his life uncomfortable, and we at
the same time perceive that his body has not undergone
emaciation, we are naturally led to suspect the truth
of his statement; and we shall find little difficulty in
verifying, or dispelling our suspicions; nor ought we
to forget, in an inquiry of this nature, to learn
whether the patient has in truth ever flown to any remedy
for relief; for if he be an impostor, however
cheerfully he may have appeared to submit to medical
discipline, we shall find upon minute examination
that he has uniformly neglected every plan proposed
for his cure. <i>Galen</i> was, from a circumstance of this
kind, led to the detection of a person who feigned a
fit of cholic, in order to avoid attending a public assembly,
but he was observed to neglect the remedy
(<i>Philonium</i>) which had uniformly relieved him,
when labouring under the actual attack of the disease
to which he was in reality subject. We should,
moreover, be informed respecting the previous character,
habits, constitution, and former complaints
of the suspected invalid; and we should learn the ostensible
reasons which the individual in question may
have for feigning ill health, whether for temporary
or permanent purposes. The inspections should be
conducted in private, for it has been remarked by
those most experienced in these subjects, that the
number of spectators always increases the obstinacy
of the impostor.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the more ordinary modes of investigation
have failed in leading to the detection of an imposture,
of whose existence we entertain but little doubt, we
may proceed to a system of intimidation, and to severe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>discipline; few impostors, however sturdy, can
withstand the cravings of hunger, blistering, the affusions
of cold water, and above all a continual nausea
from the administration of divided doses of <em>Tartarized
Antimony</em>; and yet exceptions of an extraordinary
kind might be adduced; “I have seen an instance,”
says <i>Dr. Hennen</i>,<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c011'><sup>[560]</sup></a> “where the patient
admitted of all the preparatory measures of amputation
before he thought proper to relax his knee
joint;” the same author also relates the case of a
dragoon who bore very severe riding-school duty for
some weeks, secured to his horse, before he could be
brought to acknowledge that his chronic rheumatism
was assumed. <i>Mahon</i><a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c011'><sup>[561]</sup></a> records a very extraordinary
instance of a conscript, who feigned blindness, and
baffled every attempt to detect the imposition; he
was even placed on the margin of a river, and desired
to go forward, which he did, and fell into the stream;
he was however, without doubt, aware that boats
were provided for his safety, for after having received
his discharge, he freely acknowledged the imposition
which he had practised.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having offered these general remarks, we shall
proceed to consider the particular diseases more
usually counterfeited, and the modes best calculated
for their detection; although we must here observe,
that after all that can be said upon the subject, each
case will require an exertion of ingenuity for its detection,
for which no previous instruction can ever
provide.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span><span class='sc'>Insanity</span> has in all ages been feigned for the accomplishment
of particular objects; we read of its
having been thus simulated by David, Ulysses, and
Lucius Brutus; the observations which we have already
made upon the subject of imputed insanity, will
suggest to the medical inquirer a plan of examination
most likely to lead to a just conclusion. In general
the detection of such an imposture will not be difficult;
the feigned maniac never willingly looks his
examiner in the face, and if his eye can be fixed, the
changes in his countenance, on being accused, will
be strongly indicative of his real state of mind; it is
moreover, very difficult to imitate the habits of a lunatic
for any length of time, and to forego sleep;
an insane person generally sleeps but little, and talks
much during the night, but the pretender, if he thinks
he is not watched, will sleep, and only act his part
when he believes his conduct to be observed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Somnolency.</span> This is a state of body which the
sturdy impostor has in several instances assumed; he
pretends to be in a state incapable of any muscular
motion; he is constantly in bed, retaining that posture
in which his limbs are placed, or may happen to
fall; his great aim is to appear unconscious of the
external world; the interesting case of this kind related
by <i>Dr. Hennen</i><a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c011'><sup>[562]</sup></a> must be considered as the
master-piece of imposture. A person of the name of
<i>Drake</i>, in the Royal African Corps, assumed an appearance
of total insensibility, under which he resisted
every kind of treatment; he resisted the shower bath
as well as shocks of electricity; but on a proposal
being uttered in his presence to apply the actual cautery,
his pulse rose; and on preparations being made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>to remove him to Bethlem hospital, an amendment
soon manifested itself.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Syncope.</span> It seems probable that certain persons
have possessed a controlling power over the action of
the heart; <i>Dr. Cleghorn</i>, of Glasgow, mentions in
his lectures the case of a person whom he knew,
who could feign death, and had so completely the
power of suspending, or at least, moderating the action
of the heart, that its pulsation could not be felt;
this man, it appears, some years afterwards, died
suddenly. The story of <i>Colonel Townshend</i> is well
known, who, in the presence of <i>Dr. Cheyne</i> and
some other physicians, put on all the appearance of
death, and was resuscitated of his own accord; in
this instance it is said that neither pulse nor respiration
could be perceived for more than half an hour;
he, however, actually died on the same evening.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Dr. Hennen</i> relates a most interesting case of violent
palpitation of the heart, which was produced by
the man’s own efforts. <i>Dr. Hennen</i> found that he
could at any time render the affection very imperfect
by throwing the patient’s head well back, so as to
destroy that voluntary combination of muscular action,
which he believes to have produced the palpitation;
“we must suppose,” says he, “that this person
had the power of throwing the muscles which narrow
the chest into sudden and strong action, at the moment
when the apex of the heart made its stroke upwards;”
after a serious admonition, <i>Dr. Hennen</i>
sent the man back to his duty, and as he afterwards
remained without any murmur or complaint, we must
consider his obedience as a tacit acknowledgment of
his guilt. Some persons have pretended that they
have no pulsation at the wrist, and they occasion its
cessation by pressure on the artery, or by taking a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>full inspiration, and continuing to retain the breath as
long as possible.<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c011'><sup>[563]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Epilepsy.</span> There is perhaps no disease that has
been more frequently simulated with success; its characters,
and mode of attack, offer great facilities for
the impostor; it does not require the unremitting
caution which other maladies exact for successful imitation,
nor is it necessary, as <i>Dr. Smith</i> observes, to
assume it but at convenient times; it being perfectly
consistent with the nature of the disorder to be quite
well in the intervals, which may be longer or shorter
at the impostor’s pleasure; during the feigned attack,
the blood is generally sucked from the gums,
and the mouth made to froth by chewing soap;<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c011'><sup>[564]</sup></a>
there is, however, one symptom of the disease which
cannot be imitated—the incontractility of the pupil of
the eye, on exposure to light, which in a real fit of
epilepsy is always dilated and immoveable; nor is the
patient affected by rubbing stimulants on the nose.
During these feigned convulsions impostors have often
suffered the most flagrant liberties to be taken with
their persons, without betraying the least consciousness
of what was going on, such as having pins and
needles run into different parts of their bodies; this
fact admits, in some degree, of physiological explanation;
compression on the muscles, by acting on their
nervous filaments, or by some unknown influence on
the distribution of nervous energy, renders them less
sensible in proportion as they become contracted;
wounds are thus often inflicted in the field of battle
which are scarcely felt during a desperate conflict, on
account of the high muscular energy of the part which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>is in force at the time; indeed it may be satisfactorily
shewn that convulsions, or inordinate muscular contractions,
are in themselves instinctive efforts to diminish
pain.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Hysteria.</span> On account of the variety and mutability
of the symptoms which characterise this affection,
but little skill is required for its simulation.
<i>Dr. Cullen</i> is said<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c011'><sup>[565]</sup></a> to have been deceived by a
man who, pretending to be affected with this disease,
was retained in the Edinburgh Infirmary as long
as suited his convenience, and afterwards triumphantly
acknowledged the deceit; affusion of cold
water, low diet, and blisters, will generally furnish
the means of detection.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <span class='sc'>Shaking Palsy</span> is a frequent plea on the
part of an idle beggar; and is always suspicious, especially
where the person appears to be in other respects,
in an ordinary state of vigour; this ingenious
order of mendicants, however, says <i>Dr. Gordon
Smith</i>,<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c011'><sup>[566]</sup></a> understands the art of mimicking wretchedness
too well not to have the details of their appearance
in some degree of keeping.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before we quit the subject of spasmodic diseases, it
is essential to remark that, owing to circumstances
and peculiarities of temperament, these diseases assume,
on certain occasions, and in particular individuals,
an extravagance of character which might
create a suspicion of their being feigned. <i>Lord Monboddo</i>,
in his “Ancient Metaphysics,” mentions an
extraordinary case of what he calls “jumping ague,”
in which the person affected would jump on chairs
and tables, and run with great velocity during sleep.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span><i>Sir John Sinclair</i>, in his Statistical account of Scotland,
relates also many well authenticated histories
of the same disease, and in some parts of Forfarshire
it is said to be extremely common; and there is reason
to believe that it may be propagated by a species
of sympathy; numerous are the instances<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c011'><sup>[567]</sup></a> on record,
where the accidental sight of a patient, suffering
an epileptic attack, has immediately occasioned a
similar attack on the spectator; so that epilepsy has
been supposed to be sometimes communicable from
one person to another, nearly in the same manner as
has been observed of the action of yawning; and
agreeably to a notion alluded to by the poet—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dum spectant oculi læsos, lædunter et ipsi.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Similar spasmodic diseases have been occasioned
by religious enthusiasm, and propagated by sympathy,
have become in a very wonderful manner epidemic;<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c011'><sup>[568]</sup></a>
in such cases, although we must consider
those in whom the affection originated as designing
impostors, we are bound to acquit the general mass
of sufferers of any blame, except that which may attach
to excessive credulity.<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c011'><sup>[569]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span><span class='sc'>Fever.</span> The state of the system after a night’s
debauch may deceive a person unaccustomed to such
inspections. Emetics have also been taken with the
same view, and the face has been exposed to the fumes
of sulphur. <i>Foderé</i> likewise states that paleness has
been induced by smoking <em>Cummin seeds</em>;<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c011'><sup>[570]</sup></a> and we
have heard that a paroxysm of fever may be excited
and kept up by the introduction of a clove of garlic
into the rectum. <i>Dr. Hennen</i> says that he has seen
many attempts to simulate fever by whitening the
tongue with chalk, &amp;c. and he has often met with
old soldiers profoundly versed in the history of a paroxysm
of intermittent, and very skilful in imitating
the rigors. The detection, however, of such artifices
cannot be difficult.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dropsy.</span> This is more generally feigned by pregnant
women, and for the means to be employed for
the detection of the fraud, we must refer the reader
to our section on utero-gestation. <i>Sauvages</i> relates
the case of a mendicant who gave to his child the appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>of hydrocephalus by piercing the integuments
of the head, and gradually introducing air;
and <i>Ambrose Paré</i> mentions a similar practice for
the purpose of counterfeiting hydrocele.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Jaundice.</span> If any attempt should be made to colour
the skin yellow, the whiteness of the tunica conjunctiva,
as well as the appearance of the urine and
fœces of the patient, will always detect the imposition.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Hæmopthysis.</span> This disease has been frequently
feigned by sucking blood from the cheeks, gums, &amp;c.
but the professional inspector can never be deceived
by such artifices; the appearance of the sputa, the
state of pulse, &amp;c. will always indicate the truth;
besides which detection must be insured by a careful
examination of the mouth and fauces.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Vomiting of Blood.</span> <i>Sauvages</i> relates the case
of a young woman who, to avoid the confinement of a
convent, swallowed a quantity of bullock’s blood,
and vomited it up in the presence of a physician sent
to examine her. Where such a trick is suspected,
we have only to secure the patient from the necessary
supplies, and the fraud is at once detected.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Vomiting of Urine.</span> Where this is asserted we
may safely pronounce the patient an impostor, for the
event is physiologically impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Bloody Urine.</span> An appearance of this nature is
often produced in India by eating the Indian fig (<i>Cactus
Opuntia</i>), or the fruit of the prickly pear, which
imparts to the urine a blood-red colour. It has been
also simulated by clandestinely pouring real blood,
or colouring matter, into the night utensils. There
is an old story of a boy who imposed on many by pretending
to pass black urine; but being confined, he
was detected in an attempt to secrete an ink-bottle,
which pointed out the mode of his imposture.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span><span class='sc'>Incontinence of Urine.</span> The simulation of
this affection may be detected by giving the patient a
full dose of opium at night, without his knowledge,
and introducing the catheter during sleep, or, by
taking him by surprise during the day, and introducing
the same instrument; when, if he be an impostor,
it will be found that the urine has not drained off,
<i>guttatim</i>, as it was secreted, but that the bladder
possesses the power of retention. If the bed clothes
are not found wet after a full dose of opium, during
the operation of which the patient has been suddenly
awoke, we may also be satisfied that there is no incontinence.
<i>Foderé</i> says that if the penis is secured
by a ligature, it will swell considerably in the real
incontinence, in consequence of the urine running
into the urethra; but that no such effect will happen
if the disease be feigned.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Gravel and Stone.</span> All impositions upon this
subject may be detected by chemical analysis; in general,
it will be sufficient to saw the pretended calculus
into two parts, when the absence of the characteristic
structure will establish the fraud; it will
frequently be found that they are small pebbles, or
coarse siliceous sand; <i>Mr. Wilson</i><a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c011'><sup>[571]</sup></a> has related two
instances of this kind in which an attempt was made
to practise on his credulity; “many years ago,” says
he, “when I resided in the house of <i>Mr. Cruikshank</i>,
a person brought his son to that gentleman for surgical
advice, asserting that the boy had long been
cruelly afflicted with stone; in proof of which he produced
several pieces of hard slaty substances, which
he stated he had assisted the child in removing from
the urethra; upon my expressing an opinion that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>these were not urinary concretions, he pretended to
be angry, and indignantly left the house, declaring
that he would seek for a surgeon to perform the operation
for the removal of the stone, whose humanity
would not let him doubt the assertion of a father,
who, though in poverty, would gladly sacrifice his
own existence to save that of his son: a few days
after this he brought back the boy with a large piece
of slate sticking in the urethra, which had torn the
inner membrane, and from the swelling it had produced,
was with much difficulty removed; wishing
to detect the imposture, I persuaded him to leave
the boy in <i>Mr. Cruikshank’s</i> house, under the pretence
that the operation of lithotomy should be performed,
if necessary; and it was only after the forms
of binding the boy and bandaging his eyes were gone
through, that he could be prevailed upon to confess
his father had taught him to introduce these substances,
which he had procured from coals, for the
purpose of exciting commisseration for his pretended
sufferings, and obtaining money from the charitably
disposed; and perhaps, in this instance, to have extorted
money from the surgeon to conceal his ignorance,
had he seriously attempted to perform any operation.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Alvine Concretions.</span> It sometimes occurs that
bodies of a very anomalous kind are passed from the
intestines; but the medical practitioner by a careful
examination of the substance, and a minute inquiry
into the nature of all the ingesta, will frequently succeed
in tracing their origin. <i>Dr. Marcet</i>, in his
“Essay on Calculous Disorders,” relates some interesting
instances of this kind, which we shall notice in
this place, in order to put the medical man on his
guard when called upon to deliver his opinion upon
such occasions. The first case is that of some concretions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>put into <i>Dr. Marcet’s</i> hands by <i>Sir Astley
Cooper</i>, and which had been discharged by a female
patient, under circumstances which made it questionable
whether they had proceeded from the rectum, or
from the urethra; they were, however, discovered
to be pieces of undigested cheese formed into balls
by the action of the intestines, or portions of caseous
matter actually formed in the intestines from milk taken
as nourishment by the person, and coagulated by the
gastric juices into those undigestible masses. Another
singular species of intestinal calculus was found by <i>Dr.
Marcet</i> and <i>Dr. Wollaston</i> to be oat-seeds, derived
from the oaten cake which the patient had eaten. <i>Dr.
Marcet</i> also describes a concretion which, by the assistance
of <i>Dr. Wollaston</i>, he discovered to be those
small woody knots which are often found in certain
pears, and which the person had previously eaten.
The last case which he <a id='rel'></a>relates is not less curious; a
philosophical gentleman of delicate health, and disordered
system, voided a number of small red globular
bodies, each of which had in its centre two black
opaque spots; they were supposed to be peculiar
animals connected with his disorder, but <i>Dr. Wollaston</i>
soon satisfied himself that they were nothing
but the spawn of lobsters, an extremely indigestible
substance, of which the patient acknowledged to have
eaten about the time he passed these bodies. The
author has deemed it necessary to introduce this subject
under the present article; for, strange as it may
appear, it not unfrequently happens, as <i>Dr. Marcet</i>
has stated, that persons apparently respectable, produce
bodies, as having been voided, which are wholly
supposititious.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Abstinence from Food.</span> Long fasting, or the
power of refraining altogether from food for years,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>has been frequently the subject of imposition. The
case of <i>Anne Moore</i>, of Tetbury, must be in the recollection
of all our readers<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c011'><sup>[572]</sup></a>; and in the <cite>Philosophical
Transactions</cite> two cases are recorded, in one of
which a man is said to have taken nothing but water
for eighteen years, with now and then during a certain
period of the year, a draught of clarified honey;
but the case which has excited public interest in the
greatest degree, is that of <i>Elizabeth Canning</i>, (<i>for
whose trial, see</i> 10 <i>Harg. St. Tri.</i> 205, <i>and</i> 19 <i>Howel
St. Tri.</i> 262) who, among other circumstances, pretended
that she had been confined in a loft from Tuesday
the 2d of January at four o’clock, <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> until
Monday the 29th, at four <span class='fss'>P. M.</span> and that during this
period she had had no sustenance, except about
twenty-four pieces of bread to the amount of a quartern
loaf, a penny mince-pye, and between three or
four quarts of water; and yet that on the 28th day she
made her escape by jumping out of the window, and
walked twelve miles in six hours without taking
food.<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c011'><sup>[573]</sup></a> This story, incredible as it may appear, was
actually believed by many persons, and popular clamour
rose to a most indecent height; bills of indictment
were preferred, and libels circulated without
example either as to number or virulence; and <i>Mary
Squires</i>, an unfortunate old gipsey, was condemned
to death for the robbery charged to have been
committed previous to this alleged, wanton imprisonment
of the impostress <i>Canning</i>. One of the most
interesting points in the evidence of these trials, (for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>there were several on different grounds,) was derived
from the inspection of the linen of the impostress by
an ingenious midwife, (19 <i>How. St. Tri.</i> 428) who
observed that in twenty-eight days a menstrual period
would probably have occurred, and yet there was no
vestige of such an event to be traced on the linen; thus
may physiological circumstances often elucidate points
apparently remote from medical cognizance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Deafness and Dumbness.</span> Where the former of
these maladies is alone simulated, the inspector will
be able, with a little address, to detect the imposture;
a sudden noise will frequently betray the patient,
and an instance of this kind is related by <i>Ambrose
Paré</i>; we may also contrive to communicate in his
presence some circumstance in which he is greatly
interested, and notice the effect of the intelligence
upon his countenance, or upon his pulse. Where
dumbness is only feigned, we should remember that
the powers of articulation never leave a person without
some cause, which medical inquiry must discover.
It has been a question whether the absence of the
tongue should be considered a sufficient reason for
muteness; although we cannot dispute the validity of
such a proof, it is necessary to know that cases are
recorded<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c011'><sup>[574]</sup></a> where persons did very well without that
organ; but we are inclined to believe with Dr. Smith,
that the muscles belonging to the tongue were, in
such cases, not deficient. But these observations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>apply to instances of imposture, where deafness or
dumbness have been singly simulated; suppose a medical
practitioner is called upon to examine a patient
who declares himself to labour under the misfortune
of congenital deafness, and consequent dumbness,
what plan of investigation is he to pursue upon such
an occasion? It must be admitted that where this
simulation is well performed, it becomes extremely
difficult to detect it; but it requires so much art and
perseverance that few persons will be found capable
of the deception: <i>M. Sichard</i> succeeded in the detection
of a most accomplished impostor, by requiring
him to answer a number of queries in writing; when,
the Abbé soon found that he spelt several words in
compliance with their sound, instead of according to
their established orthography; by substituting for instance
the <i>c</i> for the <i>q</i>, which at once enabled the Abbé
to declare that it was impossible that he should have
been deaf and dumb from his birth, because he wrote
as we <em>hear</em>, and not, as in the case of the real deaf
and dumb, as we <em>see</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Blindness.</span> In cases of alledged amaurosis, the
practitioner has generally relied upon the contractility
of the pupil, as a test of vision; but <i>Richter</i>
asserts that nothing positive can be drawn from the
mobility or immobility of the iris, as sometimes the
one and sometimes the other occurs; if however the
pupil does not contract, we must think that the practitioner
is authorised in concluding as to the existence
of the disease. By unexpectedly reflecting the rays
of the sun, by means of a mirror, upon the eye of the
patient, we shall generally be able to discover any
deception that may have been practised. Where
short-sightedness is pleaded as a disqualification, the
truth may be easily ascertained by inspection. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>French adopted a very simple and ingenious mode of
distinguishing the feigned myopes who endeavoured
to escape the conscription laws; they placed spectacles
of various powers upon the persons to be examined,
and suddenly bringing before their eyes a
printed paper, the subject of which was wholly unknown
to them, the facility with which the person
read pointed out with tolerable accuracy the state of
his vision. A myope, for instance, and none but a
myope, could read fluently a paper, brought close to
his eyes, with <a id='con'></a>concave glasses, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Ophthalmia.</span> This affection has been sometimes
induced by the application of corrosive sublimate;
if, says <i>Dr. Hennen</i>,<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c011'><sup>[575]</sup></a> in any suspected corps we
find that the right eye is universally affected, it gives
a reasonable ground to suppose, that the deleterious
substance has been put in preference into that eye,
from design, or perhaps from the facility which the
impostor derives from his right hand; a left-handed
person will, for the same reason, inflict the injury on
the left side.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Ulcers</span>, &amp;c. External sores are constantly feigned
by mendicants to obtain relief, or by soldiers to procure
their discharge; and for this purpose various acrid
applications as well as pressure have been resorted to.
<i>Galen</i> detected an imposture of this kind, where a
slave, in order to avoid accompanying his master on
a long voyage, produced tumours in his knees by the
application of <i>Thapsus</i>. Ulcers, says <i>Dr. Hennen</i>,
were formerly extremely prevalent in the army, and
were often produced by various acrid substances, but,
by the adoption of <i>Mr. Baynton’s</i> practice, they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>now rendered much more manageable; where the
ulcer is supposed to be excited by unfair means,
surgeons are now in the habit of sealing the dressings,
and so effectually preventing any improper tampering
with them, without immediate discovery. <i>Dr. Hennen</i>
says, “I had some time ago a case in a recruit,
reported to be <i>Pompholyx Diutinus</i>, and resembling
that species of Bullæ in a very remarkable degree;
after several weeks <i>Dr. Bartlett</i> of the 88th regiment,
into whose charge the man was at length transferred,
detected a shining particle of the powder of cantharides
adhering to an unctuous dressing, which had
been purposely applied loosely to the limb, in order
that the patient might not be prevented from managing
his case in his own way.” On some occasions
the <i>Ranunculus Flammula</i> has been employed for
these iniquitous purposes; in others, <i>Verdegris</i>, or a
copper coin, has been bound tight on the sore.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Hernia</span> has been sometimes simulated by blowing
air into the cellular membrane; and <span class='sc'>Prolapsus
Ani</span> has been successfully imitated by introducing
a foreign gut into the rectum. We shall now dismiss
the subject of simulated diseases, leaving such deceptions
as that of <i>Miss M’Avoy</i> of Liverpool, to the
fate which must await them; and the professional
men who have aided them by their credulity, to the
contempt which they so richly merit, from the more
enlightened part of their medical brethren.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>OF THE ADULTERATION OF FOOD.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Although it is generally acknowledged that the
representations of the ephemeral writer who lately
excited so much public notice, were no less preposterous
than the symbols which decorated his volume,<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c011'><sup>[576]</sup></a>
yet it cannot be denied that a great part of our
daily food, and a still greater portion of our luxuries,
are the constant objects of fraudulent adulteration;
and what reasonable hope can be entertained of any
amendment, while the temptations remain so excessive,
the detection so difficult, and the punishment
so inadequate to the crime; or, above all, while the
trouble and expense of prosecution continue to be so
disproportioned to the injury sustained by an individual,
as to prevent his seeking redress through the
ordinary channels of the law? these observations,
perhaps, apply with greater force to the adulteration
of articles not subject to the revenue duties of excise
or customs, such as bread, milk, &amp;c. Against the
substitution or sophistication of those whose sale
enriches the treasury, we have numerous enactments,
and were we to form our judgment from them alone,
we should conclude that fraudulent adulterations
were rather deprecated as offences against the revenue,
than against the health of the citizen. It is,
however, important to remark, that if the health of
any person be impaired in consequence of the act of
another, as by selling him bad wine, which injures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>the party’s health, an action (viz. a trespass on the
case) will lie. 2 <i>Espin N. P.</i> 601; 1 <i>Rolle Abr.</i> 90.</p>

<p class='c000'>The adulteration of bread<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c011'><sup>[577]</sup></a> is specially prohibited
by several statutes; the 31 <i>Geo.</i> 2, <i>c.</i> 29, entitled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>“An act for the due making of bread, and to regulate
the price and assize thereof, and to punish persons
who shall adulterate meal, flour, or bread;”
after reciting the<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c011'><sup>[578]</sup></a> 51 <i>Hen.</i> 3, and 8 <i>Anne, c.</i> 18,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>and making various regulations as to the assize, enacts
that bread made for sale shall be of meal or flour, and
that no alum, or preparation or mixture in which
alum shall be an ingredient, or any other mixture or
ingredient whatsoever (except only the genuine meal
or flour which ought to be put therein, and common
salt, pure water, eggs, milk, yeast, and barm, or
such leaven as shall at any time be allowed to be put
therein by the court or magistrates.) And that no
person shall knowingly put into any corn, meal, or
flour, which shall be ground, dressed, bolted, or
manufactured for sale, any ingredient, mixture, or
thing whatsoever, or shall knowingly sell any thing
which shall not be real and genuine meal or flour of
the grain the same shall import to be.<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c011'><sup>[579]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>With respect to the manufacture of malt liquors,
especially porter, it is wholly under the jurisdiction
of the excise, and yet there is no article of diet
which has so universally the credit of being adulterated,
and that too with drugs of the most noxious
quality; we have now lying before us “<i>Minutes
taken</i> (in Session 1818) <i>before the Committee of the
House of Commons, to whom the petition of several inhabitants
of London and its vicinity, complaining of
the high price and inferior quality of</i> <span class='sc'>Beer</span>, <i>was referred,
to examine the matter thereof and report the
same, with their observations thereupon, to the house</i>.”
<em>Ordered</em>, by the House of Commons, <em>to be printed</em>,
8 April, 1819. From this it very clearly appears
that the illegal addition of various drugs is commonly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>practised in the breweries; but we are nevertheless
inclined to believe that the more extensive and serious
frauds of this description, are not carried on in
the cauldrons of the brewer, but in the barrels of the
publican.<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c011'><sup>[580]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The adulteration of milk has furnished another object
of popular clamour, but we are inclined to believe
that its dilution with water is the only fraud
ever committed with respect to it. <i>Chalk</i>, if added,
would be so easily detected, and would answer
the intended purpose so clumsily, that we may
very safely consider such a charge against the London
milk-venders as entirely groundless.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to assay the quality of milk several different
instruments have been proposed; <i>Mr. Dicas</i>,
mathematical instrument maker in Liverpool, invented
for this purpose an instrument which he termed
a <em>lactometer</em>, and which ascertains the richness of milk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>from its specific gravity compared with water. <i>Mr.
Edmund Davy</i>, of Cork, has lately made a very interesting
application of the hydrometer,<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c011'><sup>[581]</sup></a> to ascertain
the quality of skimmed milk; it appears that in
Ireland, especially in its southern districts, skimmed
milk forms an indispensable part of the subsistence
of the lower orders, and it is stated that the sale of
this article in the markets of Cork alone amounts to
a thousand pounds per week; the necessity therefore
of securing the public against the fraudulent adulteration
of so important an article of diet, requires no
comment; and it appears that a large proportion exposed
for sale had been greatly diluted with water;
and that for want of the means of detection, the fraud
had been long practised with impunity, not only in
Cork, but also in other parts of the country; an unsuccessful
attempt had indeed been made to remedy
the evil by the appointment of persons called <em>tasters</em>,
who were empowered to inspect the milk-markets in
Cork, and to detain such milk as they considered
adulterated; the total incompetency however of these
officers was soon discovered, and a committee of respectable
farmers was formed, to devise, if possible,
some means to prevent the commission of so serious
a fraud; on this occasion <i>Professor Davy</i> was consulted,
and he accordingly constructed the instrument
to which we have alluded, and which differs
only from the hydrometer in its scale; so completely
has it answered the object of its construction that the
milk now brought to market is very rarely found to
have been <em>watered</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>We might now proceed to the consideration of
various other articles which are pre-eminently the objects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>of fraudulent adulteration, but neither our time,
nor space, will allow the digression; nor indeed
should we have entered into the discussion, but to
preserve the order and uniformity of our subject,
and to shew its relations to chemical as well as medical
inquiry. With respect to the adulteration of
our medicinal articles, we have already pointed out
(p. <a href='#Page_20'>20</a>) the law by which the College of Physicians is
empowered to search apothecaries’ shops, and to destroy
such drugs as may be spoilt or adulterated;
we have only in this place to repeat our desire that
its jurisdiction may be enlarged. Very few practitioners
have an idea of the alarming extent to which
the nefarious practice of medicinal adulteration is
carried, nor of the systematic manner in which it is
conducted; and it would perhaps have been deemed a
duty to have entered into a few details upon the subject,
had not the author already published in his
<span class='sc'>Pharmacologia</span> (<i>edit. 5th</i>) an account of the various
modes in which our remedies are thus deprived
of their most valuable properties, and described the
tests by which such frauds may be discovered.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>POLICY OF INSURANCE ON LIVES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“An insurance upon life is a contract by which the
underwriter for a certain sum, proportioned to the
age, health, profession, and other circumstances
of that person, whose life is the object of insurance,
engages that the person shall not die
within the time limited in the policy; or if he do,
that he will pay a sum of money to him in whose
favour the policy was granted. Thus, if <i>A</i> lend
£100 to <i>B</i>, who can give nothing but his personal
security for repayment; in order to secure him in
case of his death, <i>B</i> applies to <i>C</i> an insurer, to insure
his life in favour of <i>A</i>, by which means, if <i>B</i>
die within the time limited in the policy, <i>A</i> will
have a demand upon <i>C</i> for amount of his insurance.”
2 <i>Park on Insurance</i>, 636.</p>

<p class='c000'>The insurance must be made by a party having an
interest in the life insured, for by 14 <i>Geo.</i> 3, <i>c.</i> 48,
<i>s.</i> 1, it is enacted, “That no insurance should be
made by any person or persons, bodies politick or
corporate, <em>on the life or lives</em> of any person or persons,
or on any other event or events whatsoever,
wherein the person or persons for whose use, benefit,
or on whose account, such policies should be
made, <em>should have no interest</em>, or by way of gaming
or wagering; and every insurance made contrary
to the true intent and meaning thereof should be
null and void to all intents and purposes.” And
also “That it should not be lawful to make any policy
or policies on the live or lives of any person
or persons, or other event or events, without inserting
in such policy or policies the person’s name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>interested therein, or for whose use, benefit, or on
whose account such policy was to be made or underwrote.
And that in all cases where the insured had
had an interest in such life or lives, event or events,
no greater sum should be recovered, or received
from the insurer or insurers, than the amount or
value of the interest insured, in such life or lives,
or other event or events.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A creditor has an interest in the life of his debtor,
<i>Anderson</i> v. <i>Edie, K. B. Trin. Term.</i> 1795, but it
must be for a good and legal consideration, not for
gaming, <i>Dwyer</i> v. <i>Edie, Hill. Term.</i> 1788. If the
creditor be paid by the executors, though from funds
furnished <i>aliunde</i>, (their testator having died insolvent)
he cannot recover against the insurers. <i>Godall
and others</i> v. <i>Boldero and others</i>, 9 <i>East</i> 72.</p>

<p class='c000'>Death by suicide, or the hands of justice, is generally
excepted in all policies, and no premium is returned,
though such event should happen on the day
of insurance, by <i>Lord Mansfield</i> in <i>Bermon</i> v. <i>Woodbridge,
Doug.</i> 789 and in <i>Tyrie</i> v. <i>Fletcher, Cowp.</i>
669; and as this is a matter of contract, it appears to
be unimportant whether the party dying by his own
hands be found <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">felo de se</span></i> or not.</p>

<p class='c000'>And if there be any fraudulent concealment as to
the state of the party’s health or age<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c011'><sup>[582]</sup></a> the policy is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>void. But “even where there is an express warranty
that the person is in good health, it is sufficient that
he is in a reasonable good state of health; for it
never can mean that the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cetui que vie</span></i> is perfectly free
from the seeds of disorder. Nay even if the person,
whose life was insured, laboured under a particular
infirmity, if it can be proved by medical men, that it
did not at all, in their judgment, contribute to his
death, the warranty of health has been fully complied
with, and the insurer is liable. 2 <i>Park</i> on Ins. 649.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thus in an action on a policy made on the life of
<i>Sir James Ross</i>, for one year from <i>October 1759</i> to
<i>October 1760, warranted in good health at the time of
making the policy</i>; the fact was, that <i>Sir James</i> had
received a wound at the battle of La Feldt in the year
1747, in his loins, which had occasioned a partial relaxation
or palsy, so that he could not retain his
urine or fœces, and which was not mentioned to the
insurer. <i>Sir James</i> died of a malignant fever within
the time of the insurance. All the physicians and
surgeons who were examined for the plaintiff, swore
that the wound had no sort of connection with the fever;
and that the want of retention was not a disorder
that shortened life, but he might, notwithstanding
that, have lived to the common age of man; and the
surgeons who opened him said, that his intestines
were all sound. There was one physician examined
for the defendant, who said, the want of retention
was paralytic; but being asked to explain, he said
it was only a local palsy, arising from the wound,
but did not affect life; but upon the whole he did not
look upon him as a good life.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<i>Lord Mansfield.</i>—The question of fraud cannot
exist in this case. When a man make insurance on
a life generally, without any representation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>state of the life insured, the insurer takes all the risk,
unless there was some fraud in the person insuring,
either by his suppressing some circumstance which
he knew, or by alleging what was false. But if the
person insuring knew no more than the insurer, the
latter takes the risk. In this case there is a warranty,
and wherever that is the case, it must at all events
be proved that the party was a good life, which
makes the question on a warranty much larger than
that on a fraud. Here it is proved that there was no
representation at all, as to the state of life, &amp;c. But
where there is a warranty, then nothing need be
told; but it must in general be proved, if litigated,
<em>that the life was in fact a good one, and so it may be,
though he have a particular infirmity</em>. The only question
is, <em>Whether he was in a reasonable good state of
health, and such a life as ought to be insured on common
terms?</em>” The jury upon this direction, without
going out of court, found a verdict for the plaintiff.
<i>Ibid.</i> 1 <i>Black. Rep.</i> 312.</p>

<p class='c000'>In <i>Willis</i> v. <i>Poole</i>, which was on a case of gout,<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c011'><sup>[583]</sup></a>
the same learned judge said, “<em>Such a warranty can
never mean that a man has not the seeds of disorder</em>.
We are all born with the seeds of mortality in us.
A man subject to the gout is a life capable of being insured,
if he has no sickness at the time to make it an
unequal contract. <i>Park</i> 650.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is not to be concluded, that a disorder with
which a person is afflicted before he effects an insurance
on his life, is a disorder ‘tending to shorten life,’
within the meaning of a declaration of the insurance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>offices, from the mere circumstance that he afterwards
dies of it, if it be not a disorder necessarily having
that tendency. <i>Watson</i> v. <i>Mainwaring</i> (4 <i>Taunt</i> 763).
This case turned on the question whether the complaint
with which the deceased was afflicted and ultimately
died, was an ordinary, or an organic <em>dyspepsia</em>.
The jury found that it was neither organic nor
excessive (<i>i. e.</i> at the time of insurance.)”</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Chambre</i> J.—“All disorders have more or less a
tendency to shorten life, even the most trifling; as
for instance, corns may end in a mortification; that
is not the meaning of the clause: if <em>dyspepsia</em> were a
disorder tending to shorten life within this exception,
the lives of half the members of the profession of the
law would be uninsurable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>If the insurance be for a year, the day of the date<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c011'><sup>[584]</sup></a>
is included, (thus a policy effected on the 3d of
Sept. 1697 insures the whole of the 3d of Sept. 1698,
being a year and a day) but the allowance of fifteen
days or more usually given to pay up arrears of premium
does not cover a death happening within them,
(<i>Want, Exix</i>, v. <i>Blunt</i>, 12 <i>East.</i> 183,) for the contract
is, that the <em>insured</em> shall <em>himself</em> pay during his
life, not that his executors or administrators shall
pay; and personal contracts shall be performed according
to the words and apparent meaning of the
parties, and not by a performance <em>cy-pres</em>; see also
<i>Tarleton</i> v. <i>Stainforth</i>, 5 <i>T. R.</i> 695. The death must
happen within the time insured, for if a person, whose
life is insured for one year, receive a mortal wound
within the year, but does not die till after the year,
the insurer would not be liable; <i>Mr. Justice Willes</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>in <i>Lockyer</i> v. <i>Offley</i>, 1 <i>T. R.</i> 252; but if the insurance
were for life, he might pay up his arrears within
the fifteen days.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is evident that medical practitioners must have
frequent occasion to give testimony on this subject;
but it is only necessary for us here to observe, in addition
to the general rules of evidence, that the declaration
of a wife, whose life had been insured, has been
admitted as evidence to prove the state of her health;
her husband after her death having brought an action
against the insurance company, <i>Avison</i> v. <i>Lord Kinnaird</i>;
this case is important to medical witnesses in
several points. See 2 <i>Pr. Smith’s R.</i> 286, 6 <i>East</i>.
188.</p>

<p class='c000'>This branch of the law is also important to the faculty,
as they must frequently be called upon to justify
the medical certificates which the insurance offices
uniformly require before they issue a policy, and it
continually involves the very nice question as to what
shall or shall not be considered a disease tending to
shorten, or endanger life.<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c011'><sup>[585]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>So also medical evidence is often required to ascertain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>the state of a life on which an annuity may
have been granted; where either the gross inadequacy
of the price paid, or the exorbitance of the annuity
secured, becomes a question for legal determination.<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c011'><sup>[586]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c008'>SURVIVORSHIP.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>As the probable duration of human life, under ordinary
circumstances, forms the foundation of the system
of life insurance, so also does the comparative
chance of duration between two or more lives. These
contingencies have been made the subject of minute,
and we believe accurate calculation.<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c011'><sup>[587]</sup></a> One observation
alone is necessary on this branch of the subject:
the tables have been constructed on the basis
of local mortalities, they must not therefore be considered
as universally applicable to all changes of climate
and circumstance.<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c011'><sup>[588]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A more difficult problem however is presented when
it is required to estimate the probable chance that
one life had survived another, there being no evidence
of the decease of either, though a moral presumption
exists of the loss of both. The legal application of
this question may arise from a variety of circumstances,
as where two or more persons perishing by the
same accident, as shipwreck, it is necessary to ascertain
the survivor in order to determine the course of succession.
This was the case of the representatives of
<i>Gen. Stanwix</i>, A. D. 1772, (<cite>Fearne’s Posthu. Works,
p.</cite> 37) “a case which,” according to the learned author,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>“seemed to mock every principle of judicial
decision.” <i>Gen. Stanwix</i>, accompanied by his only
child, a daughter by his first marriage, and by his
second wife, set sail for Ireland; the vessel was lost
and not a single person escaped. If <i>Gen. Stanwix</i>
had died a widower, and without issue living at the
time of his death, that is to say, if his wife and daughter
died before him, though but an instant, <em>his</em> nephew
became his representative, and entitled to his
personal estate; if the <a id='daught'></a>daughter was the survivor,
then her personal representative (an uncle) was entitled;
and on these claims the principal litigation
took place, for though it is evident that the second
wife also might have a separate next of kin, and her
representative did bring forward a distinct claim, the
circumstance is not noticed by <i>Fearne</i> (<i>see note l. c.
p.</i> 39) “The court, finding the arguments on all sides
equally solid and ingenious, waved giving any decision,
and advised a compromise, to which the several
claimants agreed.” So also in the case of <i>Col.
James</i> and his wife, who being passengers in the
Grosvenor East Indiaman, were in 1782 cast away
on the coast of Africa, and attempted with a great part
of the crew and other passengers to make their way
to some settlement, but in all human probability perished.
In this case there was greater latitude for
conjecture than in the preceding, as there was not
the same presumption that the fate of both had been
nearly cotemporaneous; one might have survived a
very considerable time, or both may have been living
at the moment of the suit; there was also some evidence
of their comparative state when last seen, as
three or four sailors, who parted from the main body
and took a different route, ultimately escaped and
arrived in England to relate the melancholy tale of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>their shipwreck and sufferings. In this case, one of
the parties being an infant, it was ordered that it be
referred to the master to enquire and report whether
it would be for the benefit of the infant to consent to
a compromise; and the master having reported in the
affirmative, no final judgment was given.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a man be seized in fee of land and tenements,
though but for a moment, his wife is entitled to
dower<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c011'><sup>[589]</sup></a>; therefore if both father and son perish by
a common accident, and the son survive, however
short the period, his wife shall have dower, for the
lands descended the instant the father died. (2 <i>Bl.
Com.</i> 132.) “This doctrine was extended very far by
a jury in Wales,<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c011'><sup>[590]</sup></a> where the father and son were
both hanged in one cart, but the son was supposed
to have survived the father, by appearing to struggle
longest; whereby he became seized of an estate in
fee by survivorship,” (he and his father being joint-tenants)
“in consequence of which seizing his widow
had a verdict for her dower.” <i>Broughton</i> v. <i>Randall</i>,
<i>Cro. Eliz.</i> 502, <i>Noy.</i> 64.<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c011'><sup>[591]</sup></a> Here there could be no
dower till the termination of the joint-tenantcy;
therefore, if it were possible that they could have
died simultaneously, the widow of neither could have
been entitled; but this we believe impossible, therefore
query, if there had been two widows and no evidence,
should the case have been decided on presumption?</p>

<p class='c000'>So also of joint-tenants (as partners) where the interest
of the first deceased passes to the survivor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>and not to the heir at law or next of kin of the deceased;
but the heir at law or next of kin of the last
survivor is entitled, (and see above <i>Broughton</i> v.
<i>Randall</i>.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Also as between testator and legatee, if the legatee
die first, it is a lapsed legacy and falls into the residue;
but if the legatee survive, his executor or administrator
shall take it.<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c011'><sup>[592]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>According to the civil law, which generally regulates
the administration of personalty, it is held that when
parent, whether father<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c011'><sup>[593]</sup></a> or mother,<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c011'><sup>[594]</sup></a> and child
perish together, as in shipwreck, if the child be of
the age of puberty, he shall be presumed to have
survived; but on the contrary that he died first if he
were under that age: regard being also had to the
relation of the party who is to benefit by the decision.
(<i>Domat C. L. p.</i> 652, 653.) But “it may happen
several ways, that the mother may perish under the
ruins of a building sooner than the child whom she
suckles. It may happen that a son may be killed in
a battel before his father; and on the same occasions,
and likewise on all others, it may so fall out, that
they both die in the <em>same</em><a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c011'><sup>[595]</sup></a> instant, or that even he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>who by reason of his age, or some other infirmity,
might be presumed to die first does nevertheless die
the last.” (<i>Domat.</i> 651).</p>

<p class='c000'>By the <i>Code Napoleon, Art.</i> 721, 722, it is laid down
that, of persons under fifteen, the eldest shall be
presumed to have survived, above sixty the youngest;
if some were under fifteen and others above sixty,
the former are presumed to have survived; of persons
between fifteen and sixty, males are presumed to
have survived, the ages being equal or where the difference
does not exceed one year.</p>

<p class='c000'>The order of nature appears to afford the best general
rule, and therefore, in the absence of all evidence
to the contrary, it is to be wished that it were
established, that the natural succession had taken
place, as if no accident had occurred; that the child
survived the parent; the nephew, the uncle; descendants,
asscendants; legatees, testators; and generally
that the younger had outlived the elder.</p>

<p class='c000'>The decision in the following curious case appears
to have been directed in conformity with such a principle.
A father and son having perished at the battle
of the Dunes, fought near Dunkirk in 1658, and the
daughter and sister having at noon, on the very same
day and hour, taken the vows in a nunnery, whereby
she became <em>dead in law</em><a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c011'><sup>[596]</sup></a>, a question arose as to survivorship
among these three persons, when it was
decided that the Nun died first, since her death, being
voluntary, was consummated in a moment; whereas
that of the father and son, being violent, was probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>not immediate. Between the father and son there did
not appear to be any data for a just conclusion, and
it was therefore decreed, according to the established
rule above stated, that the son had survived the
father.</p>

<p class='c000'>But since it must be admitted that questions of
<em>Survivorship</em> will occasionally assume a form highly
capable of physiological elucidation, we are bound
to consider the subject as an article of Medical Jurisprudence.
The physical proofs by which we can arrive
at a conclusion upon the fact of <em>Survivorship</em>, are
necessarily precarious and doubtful; but, in the
absence of all other testimony, they may be occasionally
admissible: a question, for instance, has arisen
in a case where the mother and infant have both been
found dead, after a clandestine delivery, whether
any physiological investigation could determine
which of the two survived the other, and upon this
question there have been several curious decisions;
<i>Valentini</i>, in his Pandects, relates an instance in
which the mother and offspring both lost their lives
during the pangs of a difficult and protracted labour;
when the medical witnesses, having considered the
extreme delicacy of the infant on the one hand, and
the exhaustion of the parent on the other, arrived
at the conclusion that the latter must have been the
first to perish. The Imperial Chamber of Wetzlar<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c011'><sup>[597]</sup></a>
came to a similar decision, in a case somewhat analogous;
but in opposition to such an opinion <i>Capuron</i>,<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c011'><sup>[598]</sup></a>
<i>Belloc</i>,<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c011'><sup>[599]</sup></a> and <i>Sue</i><a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c011'><sup>[600]</sup></a> have maintained the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>extreme uncertainty of any general conclusion deduced
from so many uncertain data; a judgment in
which we heartily concur. Let us, however, suppose
a question of <em>Survivorship</em> to have arisen in consequence
of a party having perished by famine, on a
barren rock; here the lights of science may assist the
decision; for the physiologist will tell us that persons
so situated will perish with a rapidity proportioned
to their youth, and state of robust vigour; a
fact which is no less correctly than beautifully illustrated
by the poet, in the awful fate of Count Ugolino
and his children; where the father perished by
inanition on the eighth day of his imprisonment, after
having seen his sons, unfortunate victims of the most
execrable vengeance ever conceived by man, sink
amidst the convulsions of exhausted nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a plurality of deaths occasioned by some common
accident, as the falling of a building, an idea of
survivorship may be deduced from an examination of
the bodies, and of the relative situation in which they
were found; it has been also said that if two persons
are found dead in the water, and it be clearly
made out that they were drowned, that besides the
circumstantial presumptions afforded by evidence of
greater buoyancy in the one body than in the other,
or the knowledge that the one was a swimmer and the
other not, we may by careful dissection surmise that
death had supervened earlier in the one than in the
other, from the appearances presented in the organs
immediately acted on by this manner of death, such
as <em>the presence of frothy mucus in the lungs, generated
by vain attempts to respire</em>.<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c011'><sup>[601]</sup></a> With regard to this
latter test, we confess that we place no reliance whatever
upon its indication, for it will be found to depend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>upon so many extraneous circumstances as to be
incapable of affording any just grounds for a conclusion:
equally futile is that opinion which would attach
any importance to the thoracic capacity of the
individuals in question. Where a number of persons
have perished from the inhalation of impure air, we
may perhaps be allowed to conclude that those nearest
the doors or windows, survived those who <a id='wer'></a>were
found where the noxious air must have been in its
highest state of concentration.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>We</span> have at length arrived at the third, and most
important division of our work, comprehending the
consideration of the principal pleas of the crown, three
of which, <span class='sc'>Rape</span>, <span class='sc'>Arson</span>, and <span class='sc'>Murder</span>, are pre-eminently
the subjects of Medical Jurisprudence.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is in the investigation of these crimes that the
law derives its greatest support from the lights of
science, and that the profession of physic demonstrates
the value and extent of her judicial utility.
Let the physician then, who approaches the tribunal
of justice in order that he may promote by his science
the due execution of the laws, fully appreciate the
heavy responsibility of his situation; let his evidence
be so distinguished by its dispassionate and inflexible
character, and his opinions be so matured
by study, and fortified by experiment, as not only to
ensure for himself the respectful attention of the
court, but to afford a practical illustration of the just
pretensions and importance of the liberal profession
which he represents. The observations which we
have already offered on the subject of medical evidence
(page <a href='#Page_153'>153</a>) render it unnecessary for us to enlarge
on this occasion upon the various duties it involves;
and yet we cannot forbear from again pressing
upon the attention of all those, who are likely to
be called upon to assist the ends of justice, the great
importance of preparing their minds by preliminary
studies; let it be remembered, that it is not during
the hurry and anxiety of a coroner’s inquest, nor
amid the tumult of popular prejudice and execration,
that a medical practitioner should, for the first time,
adopt the physiological or chemical opinions by which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>he is ultimately to decide upon the life of a fellow
creature; and yet it would be folly to conceal the
unwelcome truth, that such a fact has not unfrequently
occurred on several of the more interesting trials,
upon which the medical witness has evinced any
thing rather than a well grounded acquaintance with
the philosophical bearings of the question; and while
he has endeavoured to conceal his ignorance under
the veil of technical phraseology, he has artfully
sought to shun the embarrassments it might create by
a display of bold and sweeping assertions, alike hostile
to the discovery of truth, and the administration
of justice. There is yet another evil to which those
who are but imperfectly informed on the question at
issue are peculiarly exposed; their opinion is always
liable to be warped by extraneous circumstances, and
they are in consequence involuntarily apt to bend
facts to their first view of the case under consideration,
to seize on a few circumstances which suit their preconception,
and to neglect or distort those which have
a contrary tendency; while, on the other hand, the
practitioner who has prepared his mind by study and
experience, will, with equal diligence, seek every
avenue to truth, and will suspend his conclusions,
until the result of each investigation be fairly before
him; in delivering to the Court the opinion to which
his researches have led him, he will be ever careful
to distinguish between the duties of an advocate, and
those of an unbiassed witness; he will state whether
the conclusion at which he has arrived amounts to
certainty, or only to high probability, and will separate
the doubts and difficulties with which the question
has been encompassed by the sophistry of counsel,
from those that belong intrinsically to the subject,
and are inseparable from it. And it may be proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>on this occasion to observe that the medical practitioner
is not to withhold an opinion because it may
be involved in doubt; he is to furnish the best evidence
which the nature of the case will allow, and
when he duly performs this task, he may feel proud
in the consciousness that he occupies an important
station in the administration of justice; and that he
conscientiously discharges a duty, without the due
performance of which, the laws of his country would
be inoperative.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>ARSON.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The charge of <em>Arson</em><a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c011'><sup>[602]</sup></a> may occasionally become the
subject of scientific research, and the accused individual
receive an honourable acquittal at the hands of
the chemical philosopher; by whose interposition, the
conflagration, unjustly imputed to malice, may be
proved to have originated from a spontaneous process
of decomposition.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Spontaneous Combustion</em> may be defined, <em>an inflammation
occasioned by the re-action of different bodies
upon each other, at the ordinary heat of the atmosphere,
without the contact or approach of any other body previously
raised to a high temperature</em>. This definition
necessarily excludes that class of substances which
evolve gaseous matter of a highly inflammable nature,
but which requires the approach of an ignited
body to kindle it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>The subject of <em>spontaneous combustion</em> has attracted
the attention of many very eminent chemists, and an
extensive series of experiments has been instituted in
several different countries for its complete investigation,
the results of which have thrown considerable
light upon the causes which operate in the production
of the phenomenon, as well as upon the nature of
the substances most liable to such an accension, and
the particular circumstances which are essential to its
occurrence. The following may be considered as the
principal sources from which it may originate, viz.</p>

<p class='c019'>I. <span class='sc'>Friction.</span></p>
<p class='c019'>II. <span class='sc'>Fermentation of Vegetable and Animal
Substances</span>, as that of <em>hay</em>, <em>oatmeal</em>, <em>roasted
bran</em>, <em>coffee</em>, <i>&amp;c.</i> <em>rags in paper-mills</em>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<p class='c019'>III. <span class='sc'>Chemical Action.</span> <i>Accension of oils, by
various animal, vegetable, and mineral substances;
accension of vegetable matter by concentrated
acids; ignition of lime by the affusion
of water; ignition of pyrites.</i></p>

<p class='c000'>We shall proceed to consider these subjects more
in detail.</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <span class='sc'>Friction.</span> The kindling of machinery, when
not sufficiently greased, from the friction of its various
parts, has occurred too frequently to require much
illustration, although the immediate cause of the
phenomenon involves in its consideration so many recondite
points in the theory of Caloric, as at present to
elude our attempts at explanation; we must therefore
rest upon it as an ultimate fact, and be satisfied with
availing ourselves of the advantages to which a
knowledge of it may conduce. The original inhabitants
of the New World, throughout the whole extent
from Patagonia to Greenland, procured fire by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>rubbing pieces of hard and dry wood against each
other, until they emitted sparks, or kindled into
flame; some of the people to the north of California
produced the same effect by inserting a kind of pivot
in the hole of a very thick plank, and causing it to
revolve with extreme rapidity: this fact will explain
how immense forests have been consumed, from the
violent friction of the branches against each other by
the wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>II. <span class='sc'>Fermentation of Vegetable and Animal
Substances.</span> In order to establish the process
of fermentation, the presence of water appears indispensable;
we accordingly find that in all the cases of
spontaneous combustion which have originated from
this source, the substances have either been in themselves
imbued with moisture, or they have possessed
the power of absorbing a considerable portion of
water from the atmosphere. The firing of hay, when
stacked in too moist a condition, is a striking exemplification
of this fact; the same circumstance occurs
from great accumulations of turf, flax, and hemp,
heaps of linen rags in paper-mills, &amp;c. provided a
sufficient portion of moisture be present to excite the
process of fermentation, and the consequent evolution
of heat. <em>Oatmeal</em>, from the extreme avidity with
which it imbibes water,<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c011'><sup>[603]</sup></a> and the heat which is generated
by the absorption of it, is necessarily liable to
spontaneous combustion; the following well authenticated
case<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c011'><sup>[604]</sup></a> may serve as an illustration of this
fact: “A gentleman removed with his family from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>Glasgow to Largs, in May last, and shut up his
house, which was not re-opened until the end of
August; the house stands on the side of a steep declivity,
so that the kitchen which is in the back part,
though sunk considerably below the level of the
street, is entirely above ground, and is well lighted
and ventilated. In an opening of the wall, near the
kitchen fire-place, originally intended it is supposed
for an oven, there was placed a wooden barrel bound
with iron hoops, and filled <a id='oat'></a>with <em>oatmeal</em>. This meal,
which had heated during the absence of the family, at
last caught fire, and was totally consumed, together
with the barrel which contained it, nothing remaining
but the iron hoops and a few pieces of charcoal.”
In some cases torrefaction increases the propensity
of vegetable substances to spontaneous combustion;
<em>coffee</em>, roasted <em>French beans</em>, <em>lentils</em>, &amp;c. are of this
description. Some years ago a great fire broke out
in the village of <i>Nauslitz</i>, which is said to have been
occasioned by the application of <em>roasted</em> bran to the
necks of some cattle in a wooden cow-house; in consequence
of which, <i>M. Rude</i> an apothecary at <i>Bautzen</i>,
instituted some experiments, by which he found
that if rye-bran, roasted until it acquires the colour
of coffee, be wrapped up in a linen cloth, it will in a
short time take fire. <i>Montet</i> relates<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c011'><sup>[605]</sup></a> that animal
substances may also, under certain circumstances of
decomposition, kindle into flame; and he tells us
that he had himself witnessed the spontaneous accension
of a dunghill. We do not believe that the phosphoric
appearances that so frequently accompany the
process of putrefaction, especially that of fish, are
ever connected with actual combustion. Woollen
stuffs are said to have taken fire spontaneously; it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>related for instance that the article manufactured at
Cevennes, and which bears the name of “<em>Emperor’s
Stuff</em>,” has thus kindled of itself, and burnt to coal;
we are, however, very doubtful whether such a material
is liable to this process, unless it be impregnated
with oily matter; and this doubt will receive considerable
strength from the facts which we shall hereafter
enumerate.</p>

<p class='c000'>III. <span class='sc'>Chemical Action.</span> This proves a very frequent
cause of <em>spontaneous combustion</em>; and there is
perhaps no substance that has so frequently performed
the part of an incendiary as <em>fixed oil</em>, especially when
of a drying nature, which with its various accomplices
from the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms,
has in darkness and secresy consigned ships,
houses, and manufactories to the flames. The following
interesting occurrence is related in the <cite>Edinburgh
Philosophical Journal</cite>: About twenty-five
pieces of cloth, each of which contained nearly thirty
ells, were deposited upon wooden planks in a cellar
at Lyons, on the eighth of July, 1815, in order to
conceal them from the armies which then over-ran
France; <em>in the manufacture of the cloth 25lbs of oil
were used for a quintal of wool, and the cloth was quite
greasy</em>, each piece weighing from 80lbs to 90lbs; the
cellar had an opening to the north, which was carefully
shut up with dung, and the door was concealed
by bundles of vine-props, which freely admitted the
air; on the morning of the 4th of August an intolerable
stench was perceived, and the person who entered
the cellar was surrounded by a thick smoke,
which he could not support; a short time afterwards
he re-entered with precaution, holding a stable lanthorn
in his hand, and he was astonished to perceive
a shapeless glutinous mass, apparently in a state of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>putrefaction; he then removed the dung from the
openings, and as soon as a circulation of air was established,
the cloth instantly took fire. In another
corner of the cellar lay a heap of stuffs which had
been <em>ungreased</em> and prepared for the fuller, <em>but they
had suffered no change</em>. In this case the agency of
the oil was sufficiently evident. In June, 1781, a similar
occurrence happened at a wool-combers in a
manufacturing town in Germany, where a heap of
wool-combings, piled up in a close warehouse seldom
aired, took fire spontaneously; this wool had been,
by little and little, brought into the warehouse, and
from want of room, been piled up very high and
trodden down; that this combed wool, to which rape
oil mixed with butter had been added in the combing,
burnt of itself, was sworn to by many witnesses; one
of whom affirmed that ten years preceding a similar
fire had happened among the flocks of wool at a clothiers,
who had put them into a cask, where they
were rammed down hard for facility of carriage, and
that this wool burnt from within outwards, and became
quite a cinder. Cotton goods, in which linseed
oil had been spilt, have burnt in a similar manner,
and there is reason to attribute to an accident of this
kind the recent loss of a merchant-vessel homeward
bound from the East Indies. Many years since, several
fires broke out at very short intervals, in a
rope-walk, and in some wooden houses in St. Petersburgh;
in none of which instances could the slightest
suspicion of wilful firing be entertained; there was
lying in the rope-walk, where the cables for the navy
are made, a great quantity of hemp, amongst which
a considerable portion of oil had been carelessly spilt,
and the article was accordingly declared to have been
spoilt; in consequence of which it was purchased at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>a low price, and being heaped up together, it had
given rise to the conflagration; the inferior inhabitants
had also purchased parcels of this spoilt hemp,
for closing the chinks, and caulking the windows of
their houses, a fact which offered an easy explanation
of the origin of the fires that occurred amongst
the houses. It was moreover reported that at the
above-mentioned rope-walk coils of cable had been
frequently discovered so hot, that the people were
obliged to separate them to prevent farther danger.
In the year 1757, as <i>Montet</i> reports, sail-cloth,
<em>smeared with oil and ochre</em>, took fire in a magazine at
Brest. In the spring of 1780, a fire was discovered
on board a frigate lying in the road off Cronstadt,
which, had it not been timely extinguished, would
have endangered the whole fleet. After the most severe
scrutiny no cause of the fire was to be found,
and strong surmises existed that some wicked incendiary
had occasioned it. In the month of August in
the same year, a fire broke out at the hemp magazine
in St. Petersburgh, by which several hundred
thousand <em>poods</em><a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c011'><sup>[606]</sup></a> of hemp and flax were consumed;
the walls of this magazine are of brick, the floors of
stone, and the rafters and covering of iron; it moreover
stands alone on an island in the Neva, on which,
as well as on board the ships lying in the river, no
fire is permitted. In the same year a fire was discovered
in a vaulted shop of a furrier; it merits notice
that in these shops, which are all vaulted, neither fire
nor candle are ever allowed, and the doors are all
composed of iron: at length the cause of the conflagration
was discovered; it appeared that on the evening
previous to the fire the furrier had purchased a roll of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>new cere cloth, (an article much in use for covering
tables, counters, &amp;c.) and had left it in his vault,
where it was discovered almost consumed. After
these several instances of spontaneous combustion,
we shall relate the celebrated case which led to a
satisfactory explanation of their origin, and induced
the <a id='phil'></a>philosophers of different countries to confirm the
Russian Report by an extensive series of well devised
experiments. In the night of the 21st of April, 1781,
a fire was seen on board the frigate <i>Maria</i> which lay
at anchor, with several other ships, in the road
off the island of Cronstadt; the fire was, however,
soon extinguished, but the severest examination failed
in extorting any satisfactory explanation of the manner
in which it had arisen; the garrison were threatened
with a scrutiny that should cost them dear, and
were placed under circumstances of the most cruel
suspense; in the midst of this confusion, the wisdom
of the Empress gave a turn to the affair, and, in the
following order to <i>Count Chernichet</i>, pointed out an
effectual method to be pursued by the Commissioners
of Inquiry. “When we perceived, by the report you
have delivered in of the examination into the accident
that happened on board the frigate <i>Maria</i>,
that, in the cabin where the fire broke out, there
were found parcels of matting tied together with
packthread, in which the soot of burnt fir-wood
had been mixed with oil, for the purpose of painting
the ship’s bottom, it came into our mind that
at the fire which happened last year at the hemp
warehouses, the following cause, amongst others,
was assigned; that <em>the fire might have proceeded
from the hemp being bound up in greasy mats, or
even from such mats having lain near the hemp</em>;
therefore neglect not to guide your farther inquiries
by this remark.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>As it appeared upon juridical inquiry that, in the
ship’s cabin where the smoke first appeared, there lay
a bundle of matting containing Russian lamp-black
prepared from fir-soot, moistened with hemp-oil varnish,
which was perceived to have ignited sparks at
the time of the extinction of the fire, the Russian
Admiralty gave orders to institute various experiments
with a view to discover whether such a mixture,
folded up in a mat, would kindle spontaneously;
a number of experiments was accordingly performed,
and the result established the fact beyond the reach
of controversy. The Russian Admiralty having thus
satisfied the public with respect to the self-enkindling
property of this compound, transmitted an account of
their investigation to the Imperial Academy of
Sciences, at whose desire <i>M. Georgi</i> repeated the
experiments, by which he not only confirmed the report
of the Admiralty, but extended the information
which it contained, and deduced an important generalization
of its views.</p>

<p class='c000'>It sometimes happens that in boiling flowers and
herbs in oil, which occurs in several pharmaceutic
operations, these herbs after being taken out, dried,
and pressed, inflame spontaneously; care therefore
should be taken, when such substances are thrown
aside, that they are not heaped up near other combustible
bodies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Amongst the mineral substances capable of exciting
the inflammation of oils, an ore of Manganese, known
by the name of the <i>Black Wad of Derbyshire</i>, holds
a distinguished place; when this substance is pulverised,
and moistened with a little linseed oil, it will
in the space of an hour take fire, and become red
hot, like burning small-coal; it is supposed that
the Pantheon, in Oxford-street, was destroyed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>the inflammation of a compound of <i>Derbyshire wad</i>
and oil, used in painting the scenery.</p>

<p class='c000'>In these cases of combustion, oxygen seems to act
an important part, and by combining with the hydrogen
of oil to excite a chemical action which may be
considered the immediate cause of the phenomenon.
Saw-dust, and other vegetable matter, has been occasionally
excited into flame by the action of the concentrated
mineral acids; we have been lately informed
by <i>Mr. Parkes</i>, that a fire took place some
years since in his chemical manufactory, in consequence
of the leakage from a carboy of nitric acid.
Several instances are also on record of fires having
been occasioned by the sudden slacking of quicklime;
<i>Theophrastus</i> relates an instance of a ship which was
loaded in part with linen, and in part with quicklime,
having been set on fire by water that was accidentally
thrown over the latter, and that the vessel was in
consequence entirely consumed. In the <cite>Journal de
la Haute Saone</cite> there is an account of the burning of
a barn, one of the partitions of which being wood had
caught fire from a quantity of quicklime, intended
for the repair of the premises, having been carelessly
thrown against it. In this country a similar accident
happened in the last winter at Edmonton, near London;
the flood, consequent upon a heavy fall of rain,
made its way among the quicklime in a bricklayer’s
premises, which took fire and were burnt.</p>

<p class='c000'>There still remains for notice another source of
spontaneous burning,—the ignition of <i>Pyrites</i>, and
that of cinders from the furnaces of glass-works, from
exposure to air and moisture; it was in this manner
that the ship <i>Ajax</i> was supposed to have been consumed,
from the spontaneous combustion of coal,
abounding in <i>Pyrites</i>.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>HUMAN COMBUSTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Before</span> we quit the consideration of <em>spontaneous
combustion</em>, it becomes our duty to offer a few observations
upon a subject which appears to be nearly
allied to it, and which certainly belongs to medico-judicial
inquiry,—<em>the combustion of human beings</em>; the
phenomenon, however, has been erroneously designated
as <em>spontaneous</em>, for in every recorded instance,
the approach of some burning body, as that of the
flame of a candle, or an ignited pipe, appears to have
been necessary for its occurrence. “It can no longer
be doubted,” says <i>Dr. Gordon Smith</i>, “that persons
have retired to their chambers in the usual manner,
and in place of the individual, a few cinders, and
perhaps part of his bones, were found.” Upon this
occasion we confess ourselves more sceptical; the
phenomenon is contrary to all our preconceived
views, and must therefore require more than ordinary
testimony for its support, although we are ready
to admit, that upon any other less miraculous subject,
evidence even less powerful than that produced
on the present occasion, would be deemed amply sufficient.
<i>Plouquet</i>, in his <cite>Literatura Medica</cite>, enumerates
twenty-eight cases. <i>Dr. Trotter</i>, in his
Essay on Drunkenness, adduces a considerable number
of instances of persons addicted to the immoderate
use of spirits, having undergone such combustion.
In Paris, an essay written exclusively on this
subject was published by <i>Pierre Aimée Lair</i>, entitled
“<cite>Essai sur les combustions humaines, produites
par l’abus des liq. spirit: Paris 1808</cite>;” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>the journals of various nations<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c011'><sup>[607]</sup></a> present us with a
great variety of examples, all of which, with some
slight shades of difference, appear to have been attended
with the same phenomena: a fact which we
freely admit affords internal evidence of their authenticity.
On the other hand it deserves notice, that
amidst all these cases, <em>only one</em><a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c011'><sup>[608]</sup></a> is related where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>person survived for a short time, and gave an account
of the manner in which he was <em>struck</em> with
the fire; in none of the others has it ever been known
in what way the fire commenced, or proceeded. The
following are the circumstances in which all the recorded
cases so singularly concur.</p>

<p class='c019'>1. The persons who have suffered this species of
combustion have been long accustomed to
drink spirtuous liquors.</p>
<p class='c019'>2. These persons have been generally females, and
advanced in years.</p>
<p class='c019'>3. The body has not burned <em>spontaneously</em>, but
accidentally, in as much as it required for its
inflammation the contact or approach of some
burning body, or that of electric matter.</p>
<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>4. The extremities of the body, such as the feet
and hands, have in general escaped.</p>
<p class='c019'>5. The fire has little injured, and sometimes not at
all, those combustible things that were in contact
with the body when it was burning.<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c011'><sup>[609]</sup></a></p>
<p class='c019'>6. The combustion of these bodies has left a residue
of greasy and fœtid ashes and fat, that
were unctuous, and extremely offensive and
penetrating.</p>

<p class='c000'>Various theories have been proposed for the explanation
of this singular phenomenon; and we may
here observe, that if the bodies in question were actually
found consumed, in the manner described, it
is quite impossible to suppose that they were burnt
by ordinary means; nor, even admitting that they
had been rubbed over with a highly combustible substance,
is the explanation less difficult; at a period
when criminals were condemned to expiate their
crimes in the flames, it is well known what a large
quantity of combustible materials was required for
burning their bodies. A baker’s boy, named <i>Renaud</i>,
being several years ago condemned to be burnt at
Caen, two large cart loads of faggots were required
to consume the body; and at the end of more than
ten hours some remains were still visible. In this
country the extreme incombustibility of the human
body was exemplified in the case of Mrs. King, who
having been murdered by a Foreigner, was afterwards
burnt by him; but in the execution of this
plan he was engaged for several weeks, and after all
did not succeed in its completion.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>2. RAPE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Rape</span> is the unlawful and carnal knowledge of a
woman by force and against her will: a ravishment
of the body and violent deflowering her, which is
felony by the common and statute law. <i>Co. Litt.</i>
190, 124.<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c011'><sup>[610]</sup></a> Formerly it was the law (especially
in case of appeals of rape) in order to prevent
malicious accusations, that the woman should immediately
after, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dum recens fuerit maleficium</span></i>,” go to
the next town, and there make discovery to some
credible persons of the injury she had received: and
afterwards acquaint the high constable of the hundred,
the coroners and the sheriff with the outrage. <i>Glanv.
l.</i> 14. <i>c.</i> 6: <i>Bract. l.</i> 3. <i>c.</i> 28. 1 <i>Hales P. C.</i> 632.
Afterwards by statute <i>Westm.</i> 1. 3. <i>Ed.</i> 1. <i>c.</i> 13. the
time of limitation was extended to forty days. At
present there is no time of limitation fixed, for it is
punished at the suit of the king, and the maxim of
law takes place, that, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nullum tempus occurrit Regi</span></i>.
The appeal of Rape (for there were <a id='form'></a>formerly several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>appeals beside that of murder) has been long obsolete;
see <i>Jac. Law Dic. tit. Appeal</i>, and is now abolished
by the statute 59 <i>Geo.</i> 3, <i>c.</i> 46:<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c011'><sup>[611]</sup></a>. But
though there is no time limited, a jury will seldom
give credit to a stale complaint. In Scotland it is
said the limit was twenty-four hours; the King
against Colonel <i>Charteris, Maclaurin’s Crim. Cases,
p.</i> 66. 69. And in a medical point of view it is yet
more necessary that examination should be immediate,
many collateral proofs might be observed on an early
enquiry, all signs of which would be obliterated in a
few hours.<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c011'><sup>[612]</sup></a> This remark applies as well to the supposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>criminal as to the sufferer; both should in all
possible cases be subjected to immediate surgical examination;
the case related by Sir <i>Matthew Hale</i>,
(<i>P.C.</i>) furnishes an instance where an innocent
man might have been saved from a malicious prosecution,
to the hazard of his life, by this precaution.
<i>Foderè</i>, in his work on Medical Jurisprudence, vol. 4,
p. 363, mentions two cases from <i>Zacchias</i>, where the
falsehood of an accusation was determined by a comparative
inspection of both parties. See also the same
work, and vol. 4, p. 365. 370.<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c011'><sup>[613]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As this is a crime of which the accusation is peculiarly
easy, and the disproof proportionably difficult,
more than ordinary acuteness is necessary for its investigation;
and this can be best exercised while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>event is recent, and before one or other of the parties
can have time, deliberately, to frame the account of
their injuries or innocence: here, as in some cases of
murder, to which we shall have occasion to allude,
the medical practitioner is likely to be one of the
earliest witnesses to the conduct of the accuser (if
not also, of the accused), immediately after the alleged
transaction; to him therefore the Court will look,
not only for surgical, but also for general observations.
The following are among the first that will
occur.</p>

<p class='c000'>1st. What is the age, strength of body and mind,
situation in life, and general character of the accuser?</p>

<p class='c000'>2d. The same of the accused.</p>

<p class='c000'>3d. Had the parties any, and what previous acquaintance
and intimacy?</p>

<p class='c000'>4th. What external and obvious signs are there of
violence?</p>

<p class='c000'>5th. What surgical proof of coition, whether voluntary
or violent?</p>

<p class='c000'>6th. Is either party tainted by any, and what disease?</p>

<p class='c000'>Time, place, and circumstances of the alleged offence.</p>

<p class='c000'>A female infant, under twelve years of age, is in law
deemed incapable of consenting to any act, much less
to her dishonor; the carnal knowledge of such infant,
whether she yield or not, is therefore virtually a rape;
but whether, if the child be above ten years of age,
it be also a felony, has been questioned: Sir <i>Matthew
Hale</i>, 1 <i>P. C.</i> 631, was of opinion that such profligate
actions, either with or without consent, amount
to rape and felony, as well since as before the statute
of <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>; but in his Summary, the learned
judge appears to have altered his opinion. And the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>present practice is, that if the child be under ten
years of age, then it is felony by the statute; but if
she be above ten and under twelve, then it is no rape
if she consented, but only a misdemeanour; <i>Stat. West.</i>
1 <i>c.</i> 13, see 1 <i>East’s P. C.</i> 435.</p>

<p class='c000'>The abominable wickedness of carnally knowing
and abusing any woman child under the age of ten
years, in which case the <em>apparent</em> consent or non-consent
is immaterial, as by reason of her tender years
she is incapable of judgment and discretion, is felony
without benefit of Clergy, 18 <i>Eliz. c.</i> 7. It is lamentable
to reflect that this crime should have been
of very constant occurrence, and that it should not
unfrequently have been committed by hypocrites, who
had been entrusted with the education of their victims.
In 1758, <i>John Forbes</i>, chaplain and schoolmaster
of Dalkeith,<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c011'><sup>[614]</sup></a> was convicted of a variety of
libidinous acts, and also several rapes; and of his
having carnal knowledge of a girl (one of his pupils)
under twelve years of age. He was sentenced to be
whipped and banished: the king’s advocate having
“in respect it is known to him, that the evidence of
the rape and carnal copulation will be proven only
by girls under age,” restricted the indictment to
an arbitrary punishment. <i>Maclaurin’s Crim. Ca. p.</i>
186. 755.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1777, the Rev. <i>Benjamin Russen</i>, a puritanical
schoolmaster, was convicted and executed for a similar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>offence, on a girl under ten years of age. See
1 <i>East.</i> 438. <i>Ann Reg.</i> Many other instances might
be cited, if it were necessary here to enforce upon
the minds of parents, the expediency of minute enquiry
into the habits of those to whom they entrust
the custody of their children; and that they should
not be deceived by professions of extraordinary sanctity.<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c011'><sup>[615]</sup></a>
Nature has this revenge against those who
pretend exemption from her frailties, that to sustain
their hypocricies, they fall into greater crimes than
those which they profess to avoid; assuming to be
more than man, they degrade themselves to beasts.
See case of <i>Thomas Weir</i> and <i>Jane</i> his sister. <i>Maclaurin,
C. C. p.</i> 1<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c011'><sup>[616]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The crime of violating a child, under the age of
consent, is the more scrupulously to be investigated,
as one mode of proof is too frequently excluded; the
testimony of the sufferer, if she be of very tender age,
is not evidence; the greater therefore the atrocity of
the offence, the greater is the difficulty of conviction;
“If the rape be charged to have been committed on
an infant under twelve years of age, she may still be
a competent witness, if she hath sense and understanding
to know the nature and obligations of an
oath, or even to be sensible of the wickedness of
telling a deliberate lie; nay, though she hath not, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>is thought by Sir <i>Mathew Hale</i>,” (1 <i>P.C.</i> 634) “that
she ought to be heard without oath, to give the Court
information; and others have held, that what the
child told her mother or other relations, may be
given in evidence; since the nature of the case admits
frequently of no better proof. But it is now settled,
by a solemn determination of the twelve Judges; that
no hearsay evidence can be given of the declarations
of a child, who hath not capacity to be sworn; nor
can such child be examined in Court without oath:
and there can be no determinate age at which the
oath of a child ought either to be admitted or rejected;”
but their admissibility depends upon the
sense and reason they entertain of the danger and
impiety of falsehood, which is to be collected from
their answers to questions propounded to them by the
Court. <i>Brazier’s case</i>, 1 <i>Leach’s Crown Law</i>, 237.
<i>Powell’s case, ib.</i> 128. <i>Rex v. Travers</i>, 2 <i>Strange</i>,
700.<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c011'><sup>[617]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A female may suffer violation at any age beyond
absolute infancy; and the criminal records also furnish
examples of brutality towards women of a very
advanced period of life. As to the other sex, it may
frequently be necessary to consider, at what age a boy
may be capable, or an old man incapable, of committing
the offence<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c011'><sup>[618]</sup></a>. No determinate line can be drawn in
either case, every instance must therefore rest upon its
peculiar circumstances; this may however be allowed as
a general rule, an attempt at violation is as extraordinary
on the part of extreme youth, as its completion
is improbable in advanced old age. Sir <i>M. Hale</i>
says (1 <i>P.C.</i> 631), “A male infant under the age of
fourteen, is presumed by law incapable to commit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>a rape, and therefore it seems cannot be found
guilty of it. For though in other felonies <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">malitia
supplet ætatem</span></i>; yet as to this particular species of
felony, the law supposes an imbecility of body as
well as of mind.” (4 <i>Bl. Com. c.</i> 15). This imbecility
however is not universal, as we have previously
shewn when treating of the age of Puberty.</p>

<p class='c000'>After having determined the age, the most material
examination is as to the relative bodily strength of
the parties. It is at all times difficult to believe that
in a mere conflict of strength, any woman of moderate
power of body and mind, could suffer violation, so
long at least as she retained her self possession,<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c011'><sup>[619]</sup></a>
All accusation therefore must be viewed with suspicion,
if there be not a great disparity of strength in
favour of the assailant. But this remark must not be
construed to extend to cases, where by long continued
violence, intimidation, or other circumstances, the
woman is ultimately overcome; for her mental suffering
may very considerably exhaust her power of resistance;
“and it is no excuse or mitigation of the crime,
that the woman at last yielded to the violence; and
consented either after the fact, or before, if such
consent was forced, by fear of death, or duress,” 1
<i>Hawk. Pl. c.</i> 41. <i>s.</i> 2. <i>Co. Lit.</i> 123. 1 <i>Hale’s Pl.</i>
629. The mental power of the sufferer is also to be
regarded; if it were considerable, greater power of
resistance is to be expected; the contrary, if the woman
were weak and timid; and if she were actually
imbecile, “A poor innocent that could not say him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>nay;” the crime varies little or nothing in atrocity
from the violation of an infant. We are not aware
that any such case is on record, though the late investigations
into the conduct of some keepers of mad-houses
leave reason to fear that such crimes have
been committed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The external signs of violence ought to be enquired
into upon the spot on which the crime is said to have
taken place, and that as soon after the alleged commission
as possible; that the state of surrounding
objects may be determined, as well as the incidental
injuries, as bruises, strains, &amp;c. which either of the
parties may have received in the struggle; the state
of their clothes must be examined, and every circumstance,
however minute, carefully noted. The case
of <i>Abraham Thornton</i>, Warwick assizes, 1817, and the
subsequent proceedings on the appeal in the King’s
Bench, <i>Easter T.</i> 1818, 1 <i>Bar. &amp; Ald.</i> 405, will shew
how material such examination may prove. Many of
the observations to be made on cases of murder equally
apply to those of rape; to them we must refer.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not necessary that the party violated should
be proved a virgin<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c011'><sup>[620]</sup></a> up to the period of the alleged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>crime; for it may be committed on the person
of a married woman, or of a widow; nay more, the
law extends its protection against violence to those
who have been notoriously unchaste; even a common
strumpet is still under the protection of the law, and
may not be forced, (1 <i>Hawk. Pl.</i> 108.) and it is not
certain that she had not repented, and determined to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>reform. Yet in the case of a person of notoriously
bad reputation the strongest possible evidence would
be required to warrant a conviction.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A very considerable doubt having arisen as to
what shall be considered sufficient evidence of the
actual commission of this offence, it is necessary to
enter into an enquiry which would otherwise be offensive
to decency. Considering the nature of the
crime, that it is a brutal and violent attack upon the
honor and chastity of the weaker sex, it seems more
natural and consonant to those sentiments of laudable
indignation which induced our ancient lawgivers to
rank this offence among felonies, if all further enquiry
were unnecessary after satisfactory proof of the
violence having been perpetrated by the actual penetration
of the unhappy sufferer’s body. The quick
sense of honor, the pride of virtue, which nature, to
render the sex amiable, hath implanted in the female
heart, as Mr. Justice <i>Foster</i> has expressed himself,
is already violated past redemption, and the injurious
consequences to society are in every respect complete.
Upon what principle, or for what rational purpose,
any further investigation came to be supposed necessary,
the books which record the dicta to that effect,
do not furnish a trace.” 1 <i>East. P. C.</i> 436.</p>

<p class='c000'>But on the other hand it must be allowed, that as
this is a crime peculiarly easy in accusation, and
difficult in defence; and as experience has shewn that
prosecutions for this offence are very frequently resorted
to from motives of revenge, malignity, disappointment,
or extortion; the law has done well to
extend its best protection to the possibly innocent,
while it reserves its severest punishment for the truly
guilty. It has occurred that there has not been the
slightest ground for the accusation, that coition has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>never taken place, or been attempted by the party
charged; the ordinary details are easily invented,
and very colourable circumstantial evidence is soon
obtained by the designing accuser; it is only in the
minuter points of examination, to which the present
practice gives occasion, that she will trip in her evidence;
it is to that only that the accused can look for
safety when a well forged tale, artfully compounded
of truth and falsehood, is prepared for his destruction.
Nor is it uncommon that a woman, who has actually
consented to her own dishonor, should, on fear of
discovery, or on disappointment, or from jealousy,
prefer an accusation of rape against her seducer;
here the main fact being true, the coition having
taken place, and under the usual circumstances of
secresy, the life of a prisoner depends on the mere
question of consent or violence; the prosecutrix being
the principal, or more generally, the only witness, it
is essential that her testimony should be subjected to
the most rigid examination, and that all external
circumstances should be sought which might tend to
confirm or destroy it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first and most material point to be proved is,
that the venereal congress or coition has actually
taken place; but as to the exact legal definition of
this act, much difference of opinion has existed; for
while some learned authorities have held, that penetration
alone is necessary, others have maintained
that the crime is not perfected without <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">emissio seminis</span></i>
also. Lord <i>Coke</i>, defining “<em>carnal knowledge</em>,” says,
there must be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">penetratio</span></i>, that is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">res in re</span></i>; but the
least penetration maketh it carnal knowledge.<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c011'><sup>[621]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>So in the case of <i>Russen</i> the schoolmaster, it was
proved by two surgeons on behalf of the prisoner,
and corroborated by four others who had examined
the girl, that the Hymen (which <em>they</em> considered an
indubitable mark of virginity<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c011'><sup>[622]</sup></a>) was whole and unbroken,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>and that the passage was so narrow that a
finger could not be introduced. But it was admitted
that this membrane, the existence or non-existence of
which has been strongly controverted,<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c011'><sup>[623]</sup></a> was in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>instances situated an inch or an inch and a half beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>the Vagina;<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c011'><sup>[624]</sup></a> and Mr. Justice <i>Ashhurst</i>, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>tried the prisoner, left it to the jury whether any
penetration were proved, for if there were any, however
small, the rape was complete in law. The jury
found him guilty, and he received judgment of death.
But before the time of execution, the matter being
much discussed, the learned judge reported the case
to the other judges for their opinions, whether his direction
were proper. And upon a conference, it was
unanimously agreed by all assembled (in the absence
of <i>De Grey</i>, C. J. and <i>Eyre</i> B.) that the direction of
the judge were perfectly right. They held that in
such cases, the least degree of penetration is sufficient,
though it may not be attended with the deprivation
of the marks of virginity. It was therefore properly
left to the jury by the judge; and accordingly the
prisoner was executed. This decision appears to be
well warranted by physiological observation, for as
it is evident from the concurrent testimony of the
highest medical authorities, that penetration <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vaginam</span></i>,
is not necessary to conception, (<i>vide ante,
p.</i> 203.) it would be absurd to contend that more
were necessary to constitute Rape in law, than Generation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>in nature<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c011'><sup>[625]</sup></a>. The utmost wrong to the
one party, and the malignant intent of the other, have
been complete; and the injury on the one hand, and
malice on the other, are truer criteria for the administration
of justice, than the dicta of lawyers, or the
etymologies of schoolmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lord <i>Coke</i>, (12 <i>Rep.</i> 37.) Sir <i>M. Hale</i> in his Summary,<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c011'><sup>[626]</sup></a>
and <i>Hawkins P. C.</i> say that there must be
both <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">penetratio</span></i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">emissio seminis</span></i>, and this appears to
be the law of the present day, as decided by <i>Skynner</i>,
C. B. <i>Gould</i>, <i>Willis</i>, <i>Ashhurst</i>, <i>Nares</i>, <i>Eyre</i>, and <i>Hotham</i>,
against Lord <i>Loughborough</i>, <i>Buller</i>, and <i>Heath</i>,
Lord <i>Mansfield</i>, though present, having given no opinion
of his own; (a circumstance from which we might
infer that he agreed with the minority). The argument
is stated to have turned on the words <em>carnal knowledge</em>,
to which the majority contended that <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">emissio
seminis</span></i> was absolutely necessary; if therefore it be
true that certain Eunuchs<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c011'><sup>[627]</sup></a> have power of erection,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>and consequently of penetration, they may morally
ravish without incurring the punishment of Rape; for it
is certain that they can have no <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">emissio seminis</span></i>;<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c011'><sup>[628]</sup></a> or
a man may have perpetrated all the more atrocious
parts of his crime, and yet being interrupted in the
least voluntary constituent of it, (<i>Hill’s</i> case)<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c011'><sup>[629]</sup></a> escape
the well-merited vengeance of the law; while it is
evident on the other hand, that the innocent victim
has suffered, in body, mind, and reputation, as much,
as if the crime had been legally completed.</p>

<p class='c000'>But admitting the fact of emission to be necessary
to the constitution of this crime, it remains to enquire
whether the proof of this fact must be specifically
made out in evidence, or whether it shall be presumed.
In <i>Matthew Cave’s</i> case (Oct. 1747) Chief Justice
<i>Willes</i> directed the prisoner to be acquitted for want
of proof; but on the other hand, Mr. <a id='just'></a>Justice <i>Foster</i>,
<i>Clive</i>, J. (in <i>Blomfield’s</i> case, A.D. 1758) <i>Bathurst</i>,
J. and Baron <i>Smythe</i> (in <i>Sheridan’s</i> case, 8 <i>Geo.</i> 3)
and <i>Buller</i>, J. (in <i>Harmwood’s</i> case, Winchester Spring
assizes, A.D. 1787) held the contrary; the latter
case is the more worthy of consideration, as it was
subsequent to the decision in <i>Hill’s</i> case, and tried by
one of the judges present at the discussion: “He
said, in giving judgment, that he recollected a case
where a man had been indicted for a Rape, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>woman had sworn that she did not perceive any thing
come from him; but she had had many children, and
was never in her life sensible of emission from a man:<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c011'><sup>[630]</sup></a>
and that was ruled not to invalidate the evidence
which she gave of a Rape having been committed
upon her.” 1 <i>East. P. C.</i> 440.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Rape may have been committed on a child too
young, or rather too incompetent, to be sworn; yet
all the circumstances except this, may be proved by
other witnesses; the infant alone could prove <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">emissio
in vaginam</span></i>, for no subsequent examination, however
immediate, would demonstrate the fact; or when a
woman has fainted from the violence committed on her,
or has been dishonoured in her sleep,<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c011'><sup>[631]</sup></a> and through
the agency of soporific drugs, or has died before the
trial,<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c011'><sup>[632]</sup></a> or been murdered by her ravisher, or has
been driven to suicide by mental distraction; in all
these cases of increased atrocity, this mode of proof
becomes impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>But emission, it is said, may be presumed from
penetration, <i>Duffin’s</i> case, <i>June</i>, 1821,<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c011'><sup>[633]</sup></a> but this is
not physiologically true in all cases, and as we have
stated, that it may be prevented by accident or interruption,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>so also emission is said to be evidence of
penetration; but this is still less reasonable; for it
is obvious that it may easily occur in the mere attempt;
yet if reliance can be placed on the authorities
already quoted,<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c011'><sup>[634]</sup></a> emission alone without any
material penetration, but only by injection <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter labia</span></i>,
will be sufficient to impregnate, and therefore ought
in reason to be considered sufficient to constitute the
crime of Rape.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it has been clearly proved that coition has
actually taken place between the parties charged<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c011'><sup>[635]</sup></a>,
the next point to be determined is, whether the woman
consented or not. It is not necessary that we
should here enter into a detail of all the circumstances
which may throw light on this question; but one extraordinary
dictum of the more ancient lawyers is
worthy of observation, though there is little fear
that the error will ever be sanctioned by any tribunal;
yet as it is one of the evils of this crime that an
unmerited stigma too frequently attaches to the sufferer
by it, we are the more anxious to expose the
vulgar idea, from which some ignorant persons might
still infer that a woman had consented, because she
had proved pregnant. “It is said by Mr. <i>Dalton</i>,
that if a woman at the time of the supposed Rape
do conceive with child by the ravisher, this is no rape;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>for (he says) a woman cannot conceive unless she
doth consent. And this he hath from <i>Stamford</i> and
<i>Britton</i>, and <i>Finch. Dalt. c.</i> 160. see also 2 <i>Inst.</i> 190.<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c011'><sup>[636]</sup></a>
But Mr. <i>Hawkins</i> (<i>P. C. c.</i> 41. <i>s.</i> 2), observes that
this opinion seems very questionable: not only because
the previous violence is in no way extenuated
by such a subsequent consent; but also, because if it
were necessary to shew that the woman did not conceive,<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c011'><sup>[637]</sup></a>
the offender could not be tried till such time
as it might appear whether she did or not; and likewise
because the philosophy of this notion may be
very well doubted of. 1 <i>Hawk.</i> 108. And Lord <i>Hale</i>
says this opinion in <i>Dalton</i> seems to be no law. 1 <i>H.H.</i>
131. (see also <i>Mss. Sum.</i> 334). That so absurd a
notion as that conception evidenced consent, should
in modern times have obtained amongst any whose
education and intellect were superior to those of an
old nurse is indeed surprising: at this day, however,
facts and theory concur to prove that the assentation
of nature in this respect, is no ways connected with
volition of mind.” <i>Burn’s Just. tit.</i> Rape.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not necessary that the quantum of violence be
extreme; it is sufficient that the offence is committed
without consent; as where a woman is violated in her
sleep, or during a fit, and query if she have been intoxicated
for that special purpose, so that in truth
she should have no rational power to consent or deny;
or if the ravisher imposed himself in the night, on a
married woman as her husband.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>If a woman be compelled by violence to marry, and
carnal knowledge be had by force, it is a rape, 1 <i>Hale</i>,
629; but as there is another remedy by <i>statute</i> 3 <i>Hen.</i>
7. <i>c.</i> 2. for the forcible abduction, it is not necessary
to enquire whether an indictment will lie, until the
marriage be dissolved.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor will a subsequent marriage purge the offence:
formerly “it was held for law, that the woman (by
consent of the judge and her parents) might redeem
the offender from the execution of his sentence, by
accepting him for her husband, if he also was willing
to agree to the exchange, but not otherwise.”
<i>Glanv. l.</i> 14. <i>c.</i> 6. <i>Bract. l.</i> 3. <i>c.</i> 28.; and this was
reasonable while the prosecution was at the suit of
the party by appeal, for as the king could not pardon,
the power of remission might be properly left
to the person injured; but that outrages might not
be too readily compromised to the injury of public
justice, the statue 6 <i>Rich.</i> 2 <i>st.</i> 1. <i>c.</i> 6. enacts, that
the woman consenting, and the ravisher, be “disabled
to challenge all inheritance, dower, or joint feoffment,
after the death of their husbands and ancestors,”
and the husband, or if she have none, the
father or next of blood shall have the appeal<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c011'><sup>[638]</sup></a>. But
Rape having been made felony by <i>Stat. West.</i> 2. <i>c.</i> 34.
and a new appeal given, the option of the woman is
now taken away. It would have been unnecessary
to have dwelt on this point if a vulgar error did not
to this day prevail among the lower orders, that the
punishment of Rape might be escaped by the connivance
of the nominal prosecutrix, even after judgement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The party grieved is so much considered as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>witness of necessity in this, as in other personal injuries,
that in Lord <i>Castlehaven’s</i> case, who assisted<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c011'><sup>[639]</sup></a>
another man in ravishing his own wife, she was admitted
as a witness against him. The same testimony
was received in Lord <i>Audley’s</i> case<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c011'><sup>[640]</sup></a>, 1 <i>East. P.C.</i>
444. 1 <i>Hall</i>, 629: 1 <i>St.</i> Tri. 387. 1 <i>Stra.</i> 633. <i>Hutt.</i>
116.<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c011'><sup>[641]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>And if the party be dead “<em>the deposition</em> of the
girl taken before the committing magistrate and <em>signed
by him</em>, may after her death, be read<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c011'><sup>[642]</sup></a> in evidence
at the trial of the prisoner, although it was not
<em>signed by her</em>, and she was under twelve years of age;
provided she was sworn, and appeared competent to
take <em>an oath</em>, and all the facts necessary to complete
the crime may be collected from the testimony so
given in evidence.” <i>The King against Fleming
and Windham</i>, A.D. 1779. <i>Leach’s C.L. p.</i> 996. But
if the declaration be made <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in articulo mortis</span></i>, the
party knowing herself to be dying, then it is not necessary
that she be sworn, for the solemnity of the
occasion is more than equivalent to the form of an
oath, yet it is necessary that the party should have so
much sense and discretion, that, if in sound health,
she might have been sworn; for if she have not, then
even the fear of death and judgment may not have
a sufficient impression on her mind. The melancholy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>case of <i>Coleman</i> will impress every reader
with the importance of carefully noticing the circumstances
of dying declarations, lest, by receiving as
evidence the ravings of delirium, or at least the imperfect
impression of impaired faculties, the innocent
should be sacrificed to the errors of the dying; and
this is the more necessary in those cases where the
atrocity of the crime committed creates an immediate
prejudice against every party charged or suspected.</p>

the most comprehensive manner, the application of Medical Science to
the purposes of the law. Different writers, however, upon this branch
of knowledge, have employed various other terms for the same object,
such as <em>Legal</em>, <em>Judiciary</em>, or <em>Juridical Medicine</em>; <em>State Medicine</em>, <em>Forensic

propriety be considered synonimous with the former, for they are,
strictly speaking, subordinate divisions. Some authors have objected
to the term <em>Medical Jurisprudence</em>, as implying a knowledge of the laws
relating to medical topics, rather than an acquaintance with the medical

Matthew Hale</i> to give his judgment; upon which he declared, that “he
was clearly of opinion that the fits were natural, but heightened by the
devil, co-operating with the malice of the witches, at whose instance he
did the villainies,” and he added, “that in Denmark there had been
lately a great discovery of witches who used the very same way of afflicting
persons by conveying pins into them.” This relation of <i>Sir Thomas
Browne</i>, says the historian of the case, made that good and great man,
<i>Sir Matthew Hale</i>, doubtful; but he would not so much as sum up the
evidence, but left it to the jury with prayers that the great God of Heaven
would direct their hearts in that weighty matter. The jury accordingly
returned a verdict of guilty; and their execution was amongst the
latest instances of the kind that disgrace the English annals.</p>

are several receipts invented by the king in conjunction with Doctors

<p class='c000'>His work de <cite>Generatione Animalium</cite>, although eclipsed by his superior
discovery, must be considered as a valuable acquisition to the science
of Physiology; its luminous reasonings overturned the doctrine of
<em>Equivocal Generation</em>, that had been maintained in the schools since the
days of Aristotle, and established the universal principle “<span class='sc'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omnia

<div class='footnote' id='f70'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r70'>70</a>. <i>Henry Marquis</i>, of Dorchester, who was admitted a Fellow in
1658, left at his death in 1680, a collection of medical and other books
to the College which were valued at £4000.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f71'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r71'>71</a>. This power has however been questioned; the words of the Act
25 <i>Hen.</i> 8. are, “All manner of Licences, Dispensations, Faculties, &amp;c.
as heretofore hath been used and accustomed to be had at the See of
Rome.” The term Degree does not occur in the act, yet in <i>The
King v. the Bishop of Chester</i>, a degree of Bachelor of Divinity granted by
the Archbishop was held a good qualification. 8 <i>Mod.</i> 364: <i>Strange</i> 797.
This judgment was ably controverted in a pamphlet published at Oxford
in 1791; we may say with the author, “As to the Archbishop of
Canterbury I have no design to rob his See of any privileges belonging
to it. He may give as many titles, and bestow as many honours
as the <span class='sc'>Pope</span> himself does, provided they are not admitted into the
same rank with those conferred by the favour of the Crown, and they
do not challenge any place in the construction of Charters and Acts
of Parliament.” See Serj. <i>Hill’s</i> Law Pamphlets in fol vol. 1. in
Lincoln’s Inn, Lib. A recent Act of Parliament, 55th <i>Geo.</i> 3. recognises
only Physicians licenced by the College and by the Universities of
Oxford and Cambridge.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f72'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r72'>72</a>. Such subsequent Charters would not however annul the original
Letters Patent. “A new Charter doth not merge or extinguish any of
the ancient privileges of the old Charter. And if an ancient corporation
is incorporated by a new name, yet their new body shall enjoy
all the privileges that the old corporation had.” <i>Raym.</i> 439: 4 <i>Rep.</i>
37. For other points as to renewed or substituted Charters, see <i>The
King v. Amery and Monk</i>, by information in the nature of a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quo warranto</span></i>,
1 T.R. 575. <i>Newling against Francis</i> (the election of Mayor of Cambridge)
3 T. R. 189. <i>The King against Miller</i>, 6 T. R. 268. And more
particularly <i>Rex v. the Vice-Chancellor &amp;c. of Cambridge</i>, 3 <i>Burr.</i> 1656.
“A Corporation already existing are not obliged to accept the new
Charter in toto, and to receive either all or none of it. They may
act partly under it and partly under their old Charter or Prescription.
Whatever might be the notion in former times, it is now most certain,
that the Corporations of the Universities are Lay-Corporations; and
that the Crown cannot take away from them any rights that have
been formerly subsisting in them under old Charters or prescriptive
usage.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f73'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r73'>73</a>. An alien cannot now be a Fellow of the College, and there is

<div class='footnote' id='f74'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r74'>74</a>. It is true that the College has no means of punishing the disobedient
in the country, because the Statute is not supported by penalties;
but it must be remembered that the acting in defiance of a Statute
is in itself a misdemeanour. According to the opinion of Chief Justice
<i>Mansfield</i>, a Doctor’s Diploma does not itself entitle the possessor to
practise in the country parts (provinces) of England. He must be an
Extra-Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, or Medical Graduate
of an English University. The provincial physician, unless thus
protected, is placed under very humiliating circumstances; he is only a
doctor by <em>courtesy</em>, and therefore cannot claim rank, or defend himself in
courts of law. In a cause tried at Stafford before Judge <i>Mansfield</i>, a
physician who had graduated in Scotland, having been grossly abused
in his professional capacity, sued for redress, but could obtain none,
because he had not complied with the act of <i>Henry</i> the 8th. <i>Middleton
v. Hughes. See Harrison’s Address.</i> 62.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f75'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r75'>75</a>. To this Act it has been objected that it wants the Royal confirmation,
and it was suggested that Cardinal Wolsey for a sum of
money, interpolated this among other Acts without the King’s assent.
The story, sufficiently improbable in itself, rests on no evidence, and the
plea founded on it was overuled by C. Justice <i>Pemberton</i>, 2 <i>Show</i> 166.
<i>See also College of Physicians against Huybert. Goodall’s Collect.</i> 267, where
the circumstances are more fully related.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pin and web in the eye is alluded to by Shakespeare in Lear, Act
iii. Sc. iv. “<em>he gives the web and the pin</em>,” and again, “<em>wishing all eyes blind
with the pin and web</em>,” Winter’s Tale, Act. i. Sc. ii. With respect to the
precise meaning of this expression some doubts have arisen. Hanmer
says <em>the pin</em> is a horny induration of the membranes of the eye. Skinner
seems likewise to say the same, but Dr. Johnson thinks that it is an inflammation,
which causes a pain like that of a pointed body piercing the
eye: <em>Web</em> in the eye, is defined by Johnson “a kind of dusky film that
hinders the sight.” <em>Uncombes of Hands</em> is an expression still used in the
North for <i>Whitlows</i>. <i>Morphew</i> signifies a cutaneous eruption in the
face, <i>Saucclim</i>?</p>

been very commonly adopted by the College: (see Goodall’s Proceedings,)
it was undoubtedly erroneous, but as it was less expensive to the
parties so fined than a suit for five pounds a month, according to the
Statute, of which the defendant must have paid the costs, it was very
generally acquiesced in till 1622, when the above trial took place.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f87'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r87'>87</a>. And this has been determined by subsequent authorities, that

that <i>I, John Seale</i>, being sick and applying myself to this <i>Mr. Rose</i> the
Apothecary for his directions and medicines, in order for my cure;
had his advice and medicines from him a year together: But was so
far from being the better for them that I was in a worse condition

<p class='c000'><a href='#r97'>97</a>. It does not appear to have been made out in evidence that the
constant use and practice had been with the Apothecary, on the contrary,
they did not commence practice (except indeed the occasional
sale of some simple lozenge or electuary which was never objected to)
till after the great fire, when the known residences of the Physicians
having been destroyed, their patients were unable to find them, and
consequently resorted to the Apothecaries, whose open shops were a
sufficient guide to those who needed medical assistance. It is probable
also that some laxity arose during the preceding years in which the
Plague raged in London, for in times of emergency it would be unreasonable
to insist on restrictions which it might be impossible and

is very questionable, for the examination and licensing of persons in all

are not at liberty to abandon or execute at their pleasure. It may be
urged that this branch is rather Surgery than Physic; but as the College
have once assumed the jurisdiction, it is doubtful whether they
ought to relinquish it. The Surgeons might also disavow their obstetric
brethren, and then the matter must revert, as of old, to the Bishops,
who cannot be supposed to be the most competent judges of the necessary
qualifications. Archbishop <i>Abbot</i>, a very conscientious divine, on

enforce their regulations; in order to give greater publicity to which,
His late Majesty in Council was pleased to issue a Royal Proclamation
(for which see Appendix) commanding all persons to observe and obey
the directions contained in the <cite>Pharmacopœia Londinensis</cite> of 1819. Technical
objections from time to time have been raised against some of the
directions of this work; as it would not fall within our limits or intention
to canvass these questions, we shall content ourselves for the present

power is to be wished, and that the three kingdoms should be united

<div class='footnote' id='f120'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r120'>120</a>. The reader will find much curious and learned research upon the
origin and history of Apothecaries, in <cite>Beckmann’s History of Inventions</cite>,
<i>vol.</i> 2. p. 127.</p>

<p class='c000'>The word <em>Apothecary</em> originally signified any proprietor, or keeper of
store, magazine, or warehouse, (απο τίθημι, <em>to put off</em>.) See <cite>Glossarium
Manuale</cite>, <i>vol.</i> 1. p. 298. From the word <i>Apotheca</i>, the Italians have made
<i>Boteca</i>, and the French <i>Boutique</i>. It would therefore be a great error to
consider the term <i>Apothecarius</i>, as it is met with in the writings of the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, as denoting a character similar to the
Apothecary of the present day. As we learn from the writings of Hippocrates,
Theophrastus, Galen, and other authors, that the Greek and
Roman Physicians prepared their own medicines, it is evident that in
those times the office of the Apothecary was quite unnecessary; the medicinal
herbs were purchased of dealers, who after a time very naturally
professed a knowledge of the medical properties of the articles which they
sold, and accordingly began to deal in compound remedies, and to boast
of various nostrums; such were the <span class='sc'>Pigmentarii</span>, <span class='sc'>Seplasiarii</span>, <span class='sc'>Pharmacopolæ</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Medicamentarii</span>, of whom we read in ancient authors.
That the Pigmentarii dealt in medicines is proved by the law which
established a punishment for such as sold poison, to any person, through
mistake, viz. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alio Senatus consulto effectum est, ut <span class='sc'>Pigmentarii</span>, si cui temere
Cicutam, Salamandram, Aconitum —— —— —— et id quod lustramenti causa
dederint Cantharidas pœna teneantur hujus legis.</span></i>” Digest. Lib. xlviii. Tit. 8.33.
These Seplasiarii appear to have latterly assumed the office of Apothecary,
for Pliny (Lib. xxxiv. c. 11.) reproaches the Physicians for not
making up their own medicines instead of trusting to these persons.
That the <span class='sc'>Pharmacopolæ</span> carried on the same trade appears evident
from their name; but no one seems to have placed any confidence in
them; on the contrary, they were despised for their impudent boasting,
and the <a id='ex'></a>extravagant praise which they bestowed upon their commodities.
Μειμειταὶ που καὶ φαρμακοπωλης ἰατρον. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pharmacopola imitatur Medicum,
Sophista Philosophum, Sycophanta Oratorem.</span></i>” (<i>Maximus Tyrius, Dissert.
x.</i> p. 121.) and again, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Itaque auditis, non auscultatis, tanquam Pharmacopolam;
nam ejus verba audiuntur, verum ei se nemo committit, si æger est.</span></i>” (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cato
in Aulum Gellium</span></i>, <i>Lib.</i> 1. <i>c.</i> 15.) From these words it appears that the
<i>Pharmacopolæ</i>, even in those days, attempted to practise Physic. Dr.
Mohsen, quoting from Anderson (<cite>Geschichte des Handels</cite> ii. p. 365.) says,
that king Edward III. in the year 1345, gave a pension of Sixpence per
diem, to one Coursus de Gangeland, an Apothecary in London, <em>for
taking care of, and attending his Majesty, during his illness in Scotland</em>, and this
is the first mention of an Apothecary in the Fœdera. The first legal establishment,
however, of such a class as Apothecaries, may be dated
from the well known Medicine Edict (see <cite>Lindenbrogii Codex Legum Antiquarum</cite>.
<i>Francof.</i> 1613. <i>Fol.</i> p. 809.) of the Emperor Frederic II, issued
for the kingdom of Naples, by which it is required that the <span class='sc'>Confectionarii</span>
should take an oath to keep by them fresh and sufficient
drugs, and to make up medicines according to the prescriptions of the
Physicians.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f124'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r124'>124</a>. This proviso was not necessary, for the Charter could in no way
alter the authority given by an Act of Parliament.</p>

<p class='c000'>Certain Apothecaries, and with some reason, object to this power;
for as the Apothecaries Company have erected an extensive establishment
for the sale and preparation of drugs and medicines, the private
Apothecaries deem it unjust, that their competitors in Trade should be
made the judges of the quality of the very articles in which both deal;
the public, on the contrary, derive considerable benefit from the circumstance,
as the lynx-eyed jealousy of rivals is added to other inducements
of the public body to do its duty, and of the private individuals
to expose their errors if they deviate from it: under such circumstances
however the Society of Apothecaries ought not to have an absolute
power of condemnation; an appeal should be allowed to the Censors
of the College of Physicians, or some other authority competent to the
decision of such cases.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f125'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r125'>125</a>. The words, or party agrieved, might have been properly inserted:
as the act stands the patient has no remedy, if the Physician refuse to

</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f126'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r126'>126</a>. The latitude of the conclusion as to renewal of certificates, in
some degree cures and compensates the otherwise extreme severity of
this clause, yet the jurisdiction might have been better given than to
any Justice of the Peace; how such Magistrate, ignorant of medicine or
chemistry, is to judge of the improper mixing or compounding of
medicines, we do not pretend to anticipate, still less how he is to
determine what shall be taken as a satisfactory reason, excuse, or
justification. The most probable offence, to be committed in the
country against this clause, will be, by substitution of cheap for
expensive drugs; this is a very ordinary mal-practice which ought to be
checked, but if the apothecary have not the expensive drug by some
excusable accident, and then substitute another of equal efficacy, he
would be held excusable in a case of emergency, by any medical
authority competent to judge of the merits of the case; this an ordinary
Justice of the Peace evidently cannot be.</p>

drugs, &amp;c. are most likely to be found.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f130'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r130'>130</a>. An appeal to the President and Censors of the College of Physicians
might have been a salutary check on this power of rejection.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f131'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r131'>131</a>. We do not understand the policy of the exemption: it is surely as
necessary to defend the public from unwholesome drugs, &amp;c. whether
sold by wholesale or retail, whether bought of a chemist or an
apothecary. The censors of the college of physicians may search
chemists and druggists wares in London, but as they have no power in
the country, this point requires future consideration; for as prescriptions
are now very generally prepared by persons who are nominally chemists,
though in fact they exercise the ancient business of apothecaries, the
public are as deeply interested in the goodness of the drugs kept by
the one as by the other.</p>

Royal College of Physicians, on the one part, and the Master, Wardens
and Society of the art and mystery of Apothecaries of the City of
London, on the other part. It recites the original lease from Lord
Cheyne, and also the great expense which the society had incurred, in
furnishing and carrying on the garden, as a physic garden, ever since
that lease was granted. It states, that the fee and inheritance of the
ground and premises were then vested in Sir Hans Sloane and his heirs.
It further declares, that to the end the said garden may at all times
hereafter be continued as a physic garden, and for the better encouraging
and enabling the said Society to support the charge thereof, for the
manifestation of the power, wisdom, and glory of God in the works of
the creation, and that their apprentices and others may better distinguish
good and useful plants, from those that bear resemblance to them,
yet are hurtful, and other the like good purposes; the said Sir Hans
Sloane, grants, releases and confirms unto the said Master, Wardens
and Society, and their successors, all that piece or parcel of arable and
pasture ground, situate at Chelsea in the County of Middlesex, at that
time in their possession, containing three acres, one rood, and thirty-five
perches, with the green-house, stores, barge-houses, and other erections
thereon, to have and to hold the same for ever, paying to Sir Hans
Sloane, his heirs and assigns, the yearly rent of £5, and rendering
yearly to the President, Council and Fellows of the Royal Society of
London, fifty specimens of distinct plants, well dried and preserved,
which grew in their garden the same year, with their names or reputed
names; and those presented in each year to be specifically different
from every former year, until the number of two thousand shall have
been delivered.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c011'><sup>[134]</sup></a> It is further provided, that if these conditions be not
fulfilled, or if the society shall at any time convert the garden into
buildings for habitations, or to any other uses, save such as are necessary
for a physic garden, for the culture, planting and preserving of trees,
plants and flowers, and such like purposes; then it shall be lawful for
Sir Hans Sloane, his heirs and assigns, to enter upon the premises, and
to hold the same for the use and benefit, and in trust for the said
President, Council, and Fellows of the Royal Society, subject to the
same rent, and to the delivery of specimens of plants, as above
mentioned to the President of the College, or Commonalty or Faculty
of Physic in London; and in case the Royal Society shall refuse to

effect. Mr. <i>Taunton</i> vaccinated his own children, was one of the first
subscribers to the London Vaccine Institution, and has been constantly
on the Board of Managers of that charity. At the same time he felt it
his duty to inoculate such for the Smallpox, who through prejudice, or
otherwise, refused vaccination. Many of the poor who applied for
gratuitous advice, applied also for inoculation for the Cowpox, and
some for the Smallpox.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 19th June, Mr. <i>Taunton</i> was arrested on the Lord Chief Justice’s
warrant. He gave bail, and directed his attorneys to defend the
cause, which was to have been tried on Friday, December 8th, in the
Court of King’s Bench, where Mr. <i>Taunton</i> attended with his witnesses.
Sir <i>William Garrow</i>, the Attorney General, and counsel for the plaintiff,
stated to the Court, that he should not proceed in the present case, as
he learnt that the defendant had given notice, with every inoculation,
not to expose their children while the disease was out.</p>

<p class='c000'>“God forbid,” said he, “that those who have the Smallpox should
not be attended in their own houses by any person they choose; but
they must not be carried about the street to the destruction of others.”</p>

persons to pass through the streets, who may have that disorder
upon them, although they are going for medical advice to some person
in whom they may have confidence, is an indictable offence; and if that
person, instead of attending them at their own houses, as he might do,
chooses to direct that they shall, from time to time, be brought, or come
to him, there is no question that he is liable to an indictment.”</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r147'>147</a>. The rise, progress, decline, and cessation, of particular diseases,
forms a curious and useful study to the medical jurist: since the laws
and habits of mankind will thereby be found to possess more considerable
influence on the health and physical strength of a people, than is
generally supposed. See <cite>Observations on the Increase and Decrease of different
Diseases, by W. Heberden, jun. M.D. F.R.S. London</cite> 1801. The gradual
decline of the Dysentery in this country is a remarkable proof of the
benefits which have ensued from our improvements with respect to
diet, cleanliness, and ventilation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The long list of chronic diseases with which our nosology abounds
is totally unknown to barbarous nations, and seem to be the natural
consequences of arts and civilization; as these again shoot up into
luxury and intemperance, their effects may well be expected to become
proportionally more conspicuous. Dr. <i>Rush</i> of Philadelphia has reported,
with respect to the uncultivated nations of North America, that
Fevers, Inflammations, and Dysenteries make up the sum of their complaints,
and he remarks, in particular, that after much inquiry, he had
not been able to find a single instance of madness, melancholy, or fatuity
among them. (<cite>Medical Enquiries and Observations by B. M. Rush, vol. 1.
p. 25.</cite>) In a subsequent part of his work, the same author, speaking of
the pulmonary consumption, declares it to be unknown among the
Indians of North America (<i>vol. 1. p. 159</i>). Mr. <i>Park</i>, in his account of
the interior of Africa, says, that notwithstanding longevity is uncommon
among the Negroes, their diseases appear to be but few; fever

<div class='footnote' id='f152'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r152'>152</a>. In examining the history of Burial in remote ages, we shall find
that both among the Jews and Heathens, <em>the place of interment was usually
without the city</em>. Such was the case with the Athenians, the Smyrnæans,
the Sicyonians, the Corinthians, and the Syracusans. The examples of
<i>Numa</i> and <i>Servius Tullus</i> prove, that the Romans deposited their dead
<em>without</em> the city before the introduction of the twelve tables, which
prohibited <em>burning</em> as well as <em>burial</em> within its precincts. The <i>Lacedæmonians</i>
afford an exception to this general custom; it had been a notion
universally prevalent, that the touch of a dead body conveyed pollution;
and <i>Lycurgus</i>, the legislator of Sparta, being anxious to remove
the prejudice, introduced the custom of burial within the city. Among
the primitive Christians, burying in cities and churches was not allowed
for several centuries, and <i>Theodosius</i>, after the triumph and establishment
of Christianity, renewed the prohibition upon the old and reasonable
ground that graves <em>within</em> the city were detrimental to the health of
the living, and it was ordered that any person who should disobey this
law was to forfeit the third part of his patrimony; and that the undertaker
who directed a funeral contrary to the prohibition was to be
fined forty pounds in gold. The learned <i>Bingham</i>, in his <cite>Antiquities of
the Church</cite>, has traced the gradual introduction the odious custom of
burying in churches. It was from the idea of the protection which
would be afforded by consecrated ground, baptized bells, and relics,
that bodies were first interred in the vicinity of the church: to this
superstition we may ascribe the origin of church-yards, which took
place in the eighth century. The reason alleged by <i>Gregory</i> the Great
for burying in churches, or in places adjoining to them, was that their
relations and friends, remembering those whose sepulchres they beheld,
might thereby be led to offer up prayers for them; and this reason was
afterwards transferred into the body of the canon law. The practice
thus introduced into the Romish church by <i>Gregory</i>, was brought over
here by <i>Cuthbert</i>, Archbishop of Canterbury, about the year 750: and
the practice of erecting vaults in chancels and under the altars was
begun by <i>Lanfranc</i>, Archbishop of Canterbury, when he had rebuilt
the cathedral about 1075. Since this period many enactments have
been made in different countries to abolish so foul a custom.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f153'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r153'>153</a>. It is notorious that there are many church-yards in which the soil
has been raised several feet above the level of the adjoining street, by
the accumulated remains of mortality; and there are others, in which
the ground is actually probed with a borer before a grave is opened.
The Commissioners for the improvements in Westminster, reported to
Parliament in 1814, that St. Margaret’s church-yard could not consistently
with the health of the <a id='neigh'></a>neighbourhood be used much longer as a
burial ground, “<em>for that it was with the greatest difficulty a vacant place
could at any time be found for strangers; that the family graves generally would
not admit of more than one interment, and that many of them were then too full
for the reception of any member of the family to which they belonged</em>.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Many examples might be adduced of overloaded church-yards and
burial grounds, which have become if not serious nuisances to the
health of their neighbourhood, at least highly offensive to comfort and
decency. There is one instance in our sister kingdom so flagrant, that
we cannot omit noticing it, in the hope that attention may be drawn to
this and similar inconveniencies. There is a burial ground at the back
of Kilmainham hospital (and consequently under the immediate view
of the Commander and Adjutant-General of the Forces), so disproportioned
to the number interred in it, that the older coffins are frequently
broken and the undecomposed limbs constantly thrown on the surface,
to make room for new tenants of this human soil; yet after heavy
showers, the earth being washed away, the lids of coffins may be
plainly discerned, so slight is the covering which can be afforded them.
Immediately below the rising ground on which this <a id='cem'></a>cemetery is situated
are the Island Bridge Barracks for the Artillery, the wells of which
must of necessity be filled with the filtrations from the putrid mass
above them. One at least of the principal Tanks at Gibraltar was
similarly situated. The present Lieutenant Governor, Sir George <i>Don</i>,
among the numerous improvements in the regulation of cleanliness and
ventilation which he has introduced on the rock, has converted the
burial ground into a public garden; to this, among his other measures,
the garrison may owe some future exemptions from the diseases which
have so often afflicted them.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f154'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r154'>154</a>. We learn from <i>Cicero</i> (<i>De Leg.</i> ii. 22), that of the various modes
of disposing of the dead body, <em>inhumation</em> was the most ancient: <em>burning</em>
and inclosing the remains in urns, were perhaps never found expedient
until national animosities had given rise to inhuman treatment of the
dead. The Egyptians, as they held it unlawful to expose the bodies of
the dead to animals, embalmed them, lest after interment they might
become the prey of worms (<i>Herod. Thalia</i>, xvi.); and their mummies
remain to this day a lasting satire upon that folly which “contends
against corruption, and will not allow the grave its victory.” The custom
of <em>burning</em> the dead is of higher antiquity than we may have at first
been led to suppose; <i>Saul</i> was burnt at Jabesh, and his bones afterwards
buried; and <i>Asa</i> was burnt in the bed which he had made for himself,
filled with sweet odours, and divers kinds of spices: but this custom
must of necessity have been limited by the quantity of fuel required for
the purpose. It may be worthy notice, that according to Mr. <i>Ward</i>,
the Missionary, who had opportunities of ascertaining the fact in India,
the smallest quantity of wood which is sufficient to consume a human
body is about three hundred weight.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r165'>165</a>. A popular fallacy has long existed upon this point, and it certainly
receives a sanction from the usages of antiquity. At Athens
those who died in debt had no right to human burial, until satisfaction
was made; their bodies belonged to their creditors, whence it is said
that <i>Cimon</i> had no other method to redeem the body of his father <i>Miltiades</i>,
but by taking his debts and fetters upon himself.—<cite>Potter’s Antiq.</cite></p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f166'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r166'>166</a>. The peculiar gas to which this destructive quality is owing, is generally
<em>Sulphuretted Hydrogen</em>, sometimes existing in combination with
Ammonia (<em>Hydro-Sulphuret of Ammonia</em>). <i>M. Dupuytren</i> has also shewn
that the <i>Plomb</i> is sometimes occasioned by <i>Nitrogen gas</i>. <i>Hallé</i> in his work
entitled “<cite>Recherches sur le Mephitisme des Fosses d’Aisances</cite>” has proposed
various methods for securing the <em>nightmen</em> from the dreadful effects of
this gas, as by <em>ventilation</em> and <em>fumigation</em>. <i>M. Dupuytren</i>, however, has
satisfactorily proved that Chlorine, by decomposing it, is its true antidote,
by which <i>Hydro-Choloric</i> acid (<i>Muriatic</i>,) is produced, and <i>Sulphur</i>
deposited.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some cases the Sulphuretted Hydrogen has accumulated to such an
extent, that explosions have occurred in privies on the introduction of a
light. We have heard that dreadful ones have happened in the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fosses
d’Aisances</span></i> in the Rue St. Antoine, and in those of Gross Caillou, and
Petit Bourbon; and very lately in that of the House of Correction at
Clermont-oise, in which many lives were lost. A similar accident has
happened in London; we copy the following paragraph from the <cite>Morning
Advertiser of Friday Feb. 5, 1819</cite>.—“<em>Singular Explosion</em>,—A few
evenings ago, at the Two Brewers Tavern, Redcross-street, Southwark,
a person took a candle into the privy, and laid it upon the seat,
the air confined underneath caught fire from the candle, and immediately
exploded, the seat was forced up, and the person was burned considerably,
but not dangerously.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f167'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r167'>167</a>. The writings of Portal, Gériel, Laborie, Parmentier, Alibert,
Dupuytren, Cadet de Vaux, and Hallé, contain ample illustrations of
this subject. The reader is also particularly directed to an Essay by Dr.
Gerand, entitled “<cite>Essai sur la suppression des Fosses d’Aisances. Paris,
1786</cite>.” See also <cite>Dictionnaire de Police</cite>—Art. “<i>Latrine</i>.”</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f168'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r168'>168</a>. In the year 1809 a decree was passed in Paris, containing numerous
rules to be observed in the future construction of privies, and
which fixed upon the householder a very heavy expense. In 1819 the
French King issued a Royal Ordinance relative to this subject; it contains
thirty-four clauses or articles, thirty of which revive <em>in their full
strictness</em>, all the statutes by which housekeepers are compelled to undertake
most expensive and troublesome building, or repairs of privies.
To relieve them, however, from vexatious costs, the 31st article was
framed upon the recommendation of the Privy Council, and which liberates
those from the obligation, who shall substitute their old privies
by a new apparatus invented by <i>M. Cazeneuve</i>, entitled <cite>Messrs. Fauche-Borel’s
Patent Moveable Inodorous Conveniences</cite>, of whose advantages almost
all the learned Societies of Europe have reported most favourably. We
have noticed this decree in order to shew our reader what a degree of
importance the French Government attaches to the subject. And upon
this occasion it is impossible to withhold the expression of those feelings
of national pride and exultation which the contemplation of this subject
must afford us; we have in our metropolis no less than 200,000 privies,
of which 10,000 only are water closets. In Paris the number does not
exceed 70,000, and yet with all the cumbrous enactments which that
government has passed for their regulation, how far inferior they are
in cleanliness, and how far greater are the effects of their effluvia, when
compared with similar establishments in our city. The truth is, that
the most elaborate system of medical police will never be so effective as
the spirit of cleanliness which is so characteristic of this great and free
people; and in this truth, so forcibly illustrated by the subject under
discussion, we are to seek for the real explanation of that fact which
has been so frequently commented upon by medical writers—<span class='sc'>The
apparent indifference of our government to the subject
of Public Health.</span></p>

fact, mentioned by Dr. <i>Samoilowitz</i>, that all the assistant Surgeons
in the hospitals at Moscow took the Plague, while the Physicians
who only walked among the sick, but carefully avoided contact, generally
escaped, affords a strong proof of the greater facility with which
<em>actual contact</em> communicates the infection. This work of Dr. <i>Samoilowitz</i>
(<cite>sur la Peste</cite>) has more than a hundred pages filled with proofs of its <em>contagious</em>
influence; Dr. Granville also, in his examination before the Committee
of the House of Commons, gave some very interesting instances,
in which the poison could only have been conveyed by <em>touch</em>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f180'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r180'>180</a>. It is noticed by writers long before Dr. Maclean: see “<cite>Distinct
notions of the Plague, 1722. Dale Ingram on the Plagues that have appeared
since 1346; and Plague no Contagious Disease.</cite>” The following is the story
to which these authors allude.—It appears that Pope Paul III, about the
year 1747, commissioned his legate, Cardinal Montè, to fabricate some
pretext for removing the celebrated Council of Trent, which was then
sitting in debate on the abuses of the ecclesiastical power, to some town
within the Papal territory. An epidemic fever, it was said, then prevailed
at Trent: many of the bishops became alarmed, and fled; some,
if not all, on the Emperor’s side, raised their voices against the plot;
but Fracastorius, Physician of the Council, aided the imposition with
all the zeal of a devoted Catholic, and the Council was accordingly
translated to Bologna. From this time, Dr. Maclean asserts, it became
almost heretical to doubt of the contagious nature of Plague; and the
error, chiefly because it was sanctioned by the sovereign Pontiff’s authority
in the first instance, has been propagated in christendom, as a
point of medical orthodoxy, and continued down to the present time.—<cite>Maclean,

restrictions imposed by the Quarantine laws; in which motion he was
supported by the Right Honourable <i>F. Robinson</i>, President of the Board

were, <em>first</em>, Is the Plague capable of being communicated from person
to person, either by immediate contact with those diseased, or intermediately,
by contact with infected goods? or <em>secondly</em>, Is it an Epidemic
depending only on a peculiar state of the atmosphere? The number of
medical men examined upon this occasion was nineteen, only two of
whom, Dr. <i>Maclean</i> and Dr. <i>Mitchell</i>, denied the contagious nature of
the Plague.</p>

Main, in 1729, and 1740; and the most general and destructive of all,
which broke out at Grenada in the month of March, in 1793, which
spread rapidly to the whole Carribean Archipelago, and from thence to
North America, and the shores of Europe. The most remarkable, and
perhaps the only instances on record of its existence in North America,
are that of Boston in 1693, on the arrival of a squadron of English
ships of war from the West Indies; that in Carolina, in the years 1732,
1739, 1745, and 1748, all which, by the account of the physicians who
describe it, could be traced to importations from the sugar colonies; that
of Philadelphia, in 1751 and 1762; and that above-mentioned in 1793. It
now remains to give the history of it as it appeared in Europe. It may
be chronologically stated as follows: at Lisbon, in 1723; at Cadiz, in
1732, 1733, 1744, 1746, 1764, 1800; at Malaga, in 1741 and 1803;

<p class='c000'><a href='#r203'>203</a>. The following account is taken from Quincy: “Dr. <i>Plott</i> observes,
the reasons why Oxford is now much more healthful than formerly,
to be the enlargement of the city, whereby the inhabitants, who
are not proportionally increased, are not so closely crowded together;
and the care of the magistrates in keeping the streets clear from filth:
for formerly, he says, they used to kill all manner of cattle within the
walls, and suffer their dung and offals to lie in the streets. Moreover,
about those times, the Isis and Cherwell, through the carelessness of
the townsmen, being filled with mud, and the common shores by such
means stopped, did cause the ascent of malignant vapours whenever
there happened to be a flood. But since that, by the care and at the
charge of Richard <i>Fox</i>, Bishop of Winchester, in the year 1517, those
rivers were cleansed, and more trenches cut for the water’s free passage;
<em>the town has continued in a very healthful condition, and in a particular
manner so free from pestilential diseases, that the sickness in 1665, which raged
in most parts of the kingdom, never visited any person there, although the terms
were there kept, and the Court and both houses of Parliament did there reside</em>.”—<cite>Plott’s

<div class='footnote' id='f205'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r205'>205</a>. The earliest instance of jail infection, communicated in a Court
of Justice, appears to be that mentioned by Mr. Anthony <i>Wood</i>, as having
happened “at the Assize kept in the Castle at Cambridge, at the
time of Lent, 13th <i>Henry</i> viii. ann. dom. 1521-2, when the Justices
there, and all the gentlemen, bailives, and all resorting thither, took
such an infection, that many of them died; and almost all that were
present fell desperately sick, and narrowly escaped with their lives.”
Then comes the memorable <em>black assize</em> at Oxford, in July 1577, the
best account of which is that given in “<cite>The History and Antiquities of the
University of Oxford, by Anthony Wood, M. A. of Merton College</cite>”, first published
in English from the original MS. in the Bodleian library, by
John <i>Gutch</i>, A. M. printed at Oxford in 1796. Another instance is
mentioned by <i>Holinshed</i>, (vol. ii, p. 1547) as occurring at Exeter, during
the assizes there in March 1586. From this period no remarkable
case of jail infection is recorded for a period of 150 years, when at the
Lent assizes, some prisoners who had been removed from Ilchester
gaol, to take their trials at Taunton, were said to have infected a part
of the court, and produced a contagious disease, of which the Chief
Baron <i>Pengally</i>, with some of his officers and servants, and Sir James
<i>Sheppard</i>, knight, and Serjeant at Law, died afterwards at Blandford in
Dorsetshire. Twelve years after, viz. in April, 1742, according to
Dr. <i>Huxham</i> (<i>De aëre, &amp;c. vol.</i> ii, <i>p.</i> 82) a putrid fever appeared at
Launceston, and occasioned great mortality; this fever, he adds, was
generated in the prisons; and widely disseminated by means of the
county assize. The next remarkable occurrence of this kind happened
at the sessions of the Old Bailey, in the spring of 1750, which proved
fatal to the Lord Mayor, and two of the Judges, with several eminent
and other persons; this circumstance induced the Magistrates of London
to resolve upon attempting to render Newgate more healthy; and
they accordingly consulted Dr. <i>Hales</i> and Sir John <i>Pringle</i> about the
method which they should follow. Dr. <i>Hales</i> recommended the use of
his <em>Ventilator</em>, a machine contrived to pump out the air of any place,
and thus to occasion a perpetual renovation of it. The machine was
accordingly erected, and its salutary effects soon became apparent, the
deaths in Newgate having been reduced from 7 or 8 a week to about 2
in a month. Eleven men were employed in erecting this ventilator, of
which no fewer than 7 were seized with the disease; a very interesting
account of these men, and of the mode of treatment, were drawn up
by Sir John <i>Pringle</i>, and published in the <cite>Philosophical Transactions for
1753, vol.</cite> xlviii, <i>p.</i> 42.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r210'>210</a>. <span class='sc'>Quarantine</span>, or Quarantain, a French word signifying the
space of forty days; why forty days should have been fixed upon as the
period of probation upon these occasions is not very evident. <i>Beckmann</i>
observes that it arose from the doctrine of the ancient physicians, in regard
to the critical days of many diseases, of which the fortieth seems
to have been considered the last, and most extreme, and on which many
astrological conceits were formerly maintained. (See <i>G. Wedelii Exercitatio
de Quadragesima die</i>, in his <cite>Centuria Exercitationum Medico-Philologicarum</cite>,
Jenæ 1701.) This explanation however is not quite satisfactory;
forty days appear to have been a period fixed upon for various kinds of
probation, (probably from the duration of Lent); we have thus <i>Quarantain</i>
of the King in France, which denotes a truce of forty days appointed
by Saint Louis, during which time it was expressly forbidden
to take any revenge of the relations or friends of people who had
fought, wounded, or affronted each other in words. So again in the
law of England, the word <i>Quarantine</i> denotes a benefit allowed to the
widow of a man dying seized of land; by which she may challenge to
continue in his capital messuage, or chief mansion house (so it be not a
castle) for the <em>space of forty days</em> after his decease; during which time her
dower shall be assigned. <i>Coke upon Lit.</i> 34, 35.</p>

<p class='c000'>Legislative enactments for arresting the progress, and preventing the
diffusion, of contagious diseases are mentioned in the earliest history: it
is, for instance, commanded in the books of the law of Moses, that the
priests shall be desired to visit houses infected with the plague of leprosy,
which, if necessary, are to be closed, and even pulled down; or the
walls are to be scraped and white-washed, and the infected persons to
be shut up. (<cite>Leviticus, chap.</cite> xiii, xiv.) The laws of <span class='sc'>Quarantine</span>,
however, as directed against the propagation of Pestilential Epidemics
have a later origin. In the first centuries of the Christian era, it does
not appear to have been known that infection could be communicated
by cloathing, and other things used by infected persons. After the
plague in the fourteenth century, which continued longer than any
other on record, and extended over the greater part of Europe, the
survivors found that it was possible to guard against, or to prevent infection,
and Governments then began to order establishments to be
formed for that purpose. The most ancient of these appear to be those
in Lombardy and Milan in the years 1374, 1383, 1399; an account of
which may be seen in <span class='sc'>Muratori</span> <i>Scriptores rerum Italic: T.</i> xvi, <i>p.</i> 560,
&amp; xviii <i>p.</i> 82, and from thence copied into <span class='sc'>Chenot</span>, p. 147. See also
<span class='sc'>Boccacio</span> <i>Decam.</i> The Venetians are entitled to the merit of having
improved the establishments formed to prevent infection, and that their
example was followed in other countries is generally admitted. <span class='sc'>Muratori</span>
(<i>Lib.</i> i, <i>cap.</i> ii, <i>p.</i> 65) says that Quarantine was first ordered to
be performed by the Venetians in 1484; and <span class='sc'>Howard</span> (<cite>An Account of
the principal Lazarettos; London</cite>, 1789, 4<i>to p.</i> 12) states that the College
of Health was instituted in 1448—see <span class='sc'>Beckmann’s</span> <cite>History of Inventions</cite>,

sweeping and indiscriminate. “<em>Abortives and still-born</em>” united, form a
large number in the general annual bill, the absurdity of which is apparent.
<em>Child-bed</em> is a formidable article in the bill, and is liable to much
misinterpretation and error; all women dying within the month after
delivery are indiscriminately classed under <em>child-bed</em>, whether they die in
actual labour, or subsequently of acute fever, consumption, or any
other disorder. Infants dying before baptism are not returned by the
parish clerks in the bills of mortality. In the old bills they were entered
under the denomination of <i>Chrysoms</i>, but this title has been long disused.

the infirm person himself, that he should continue in the world, even
though he were richer than Midas. <i>De Republ. Lib.</i> III. Upon the

the life of man is divided into seven ages, over each of which

it lasteth from fourteene, till two-and-twenty yeares be fully compleate.
<span class='sc'>The Fourth Age</span> paceth on, till a man have accomplished two and
fortie yeares, and is tearmed Young Manhood.—<span class='sc'>The Fifth Age</span>,
named Mature Manhood, hath fifteene yeares of continuance, and
therefore makes his progress so far as six and fifty yeares. Afterwards
in adding twelve to fifty-six, you shall make up sixty-eight yeares,
which reach to the end of the <span class='sc'>Sixth Age</span>, and is called Old Age.—<span class='sc'>The
Seaventh</span>, and last of these seaven ages, is limited from Sixty-eight
yeares, so far as four score and eight, being called weak, declining, and
decrepite age. If any man chance to goe beyond this age (which is
more admired than noted in many) you shall evidently perceive that he
will returne to his first condition of Infancy againe.”</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r273'>273</a>. A question has arisen whether this discharge be a secretion from
the internal surface of the uterus, or pure blood; it is now generally
admitted that the former is the true theory of its origin, and it is important
for the medical jurist to know that <em>it does not coagulate</em>; in the
celebrated case of the murder of <span class='sc'>Mary Ashford</span>, this fact furnished
a useful feature in the evidence; and in other cases that might be cited,
the medical witness has been thus enabled to discredit the explanation
given by a woman, for the appearance of blood. The average quantity
in this country is about four ounces, which is generally about four days
in flowing, but this of course is liable to great variation. An opinion
has prevailed from the most remote antiquity, that there is something
peculiarly malignant and unclean in the nature of this discharge. Haller
thinks that this belief was brought from Asia into Europe, by the
Arabian physicians; that such an idea should have originated in hot
countries is not extraordinary, when we consider how rapidly blood
runs into putrefaction under such circumstances. In Africa the women
are obliged at these periods to separate themselves from society, and to
abstain from the performance of their domestic duties, and even to carry
about them some mark, by which others may learn to avoid them. The
Jews observed the same practice, and the laws of Moses condemned to
death the persons who were discovered to have had sexual intercourse
during this period. (<i>Levit. Ch.</i> 20. <i>v.</i> 18.)</p>

that naturally are never but a foot and a half high; others again somewhat
longer, and to this height they came in three years, which is the
full course of their age, and then they die”—<span class='sc'>Philemon Holland</span>, <i>book</i>
vii. <i>chap.</i> 16.—An account is also given by <span class='sc'>Craterus</span>, the brother of
king Antigonus, the subject of which history was an <em>Infant</em>, a <em>Young
Man</em>, and an <em>Old Man</em>, was married and begat children, and all in the
space of <em>Seven</em> years! In January, 1747, Dr. <span class='sc'>Mead</span> presented to the
Royal Society the history of a child born at Willingham near Cambridge,
which is recorded in the 43d <cite>Volume of Transactions, for the year 1745</cite>.
This child was not only remarkable on account of his bulk and height,
but also for the <em>external marks of Puberty</em>, which were first observed at
the age of twelve months; no evidence however is offered in this case
of the perfect developement of the genital organs, their external appearance
is alone described, without any regard to the state of their functions.
In an account published after his death, it appears that he was
attacked by a disease resembling <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phthisis Pulmonalis</span></i>, and was attended by
the late Dr. Heberden, then at Cambridge, of which he died, and after
death, says his historian, he had the appearance of a venerable old man.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following are the particulars of the case of <span class='sc'>Philip Howorth</span>, as
related by Mr. <span class='sc'>White</span>—He was born in Quebec Mews, Portman Square,
on Feb. 21, 1806; his parents are middle aged, and poor, but industrious
people; the father being a coachman in a gentleman’s service,
and the mother employed in nursing and rearing a family of ten children,
of which Philip is the ninth: the father is a healthy and muscular
man, the mother a middle sized woman, and rather delicate; the rest
of the children are of the ordinary stature and appearance. During the
mother’s pregnancy with Philip, (which continued the usual length of
time) nothing occurred worthy of remark. At the birth, the head of
the child was covered with a profusion of hair of considerable length;
the sutures of the cranium were closed, not leaving the slightest vestige
of a Fontanelle, and he was at this period considered, in point of size
and appearance, as a large and healthy child; during the first year he
was remarkably healthy, and could at about the 12th month run alone;
shortly after this period, a very visible alteration took place, his countenance,
which, until now, had been marked with health and infant
beauty, lost its round and infantile form, and became long, pale, and
extremely ugly, as if affected by the ravages of some bodily malady.
These appearances seem to have been the preludes of those remarkable
changes which quickly succeeded; at this period Nature made a sudden
bound to puberty; the penis and testes were observed to increase in
size, and a small number of black, curling hairs, were discovered on
the pubes: an evident alteration also took place in the tone of the voice,
his cries becoming much hoarser, and more interrupted; the peculiar
organic changes which have been described as commencing on the
completion of his first year continued to be rapidly increased, and the
full developement of the sexual organs was attended with signs of returning
health; the features assumed a more manly expression, and the
rapid and successive growth of the body became the wonder of all who
knew him. Mr. White then proceeds to state that part of his history
which fell under his own notice; the first appearance of the boy, says
he, is very striking, on account of the manly character so strongly impressed
upon his countenance; the chin is <em>without beard</em>, but the black
headed points of steatomatous matter so remarkable in young men
previous to the growth of beard, is very apparent. The Axilla is without
hair, but the secretion has the peculiar characteristic odour of the
Adult; the pubes and scrotum are covered with black curling hair; the
penis and testes are as large as has been seen in some adults, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus
spongiosum urethræ</span></i> having outgrown the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpora cavernosa</span></i>, the penis is
curved during erection; the testes are firm and perfect in their appearance,
and the chord may be felt very distinctly; the prepuce is easily
drawn back over the glans, and the secretion of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">glandulæ odoriferæ</span></i> is
apparent; the usual brown appearance of the integuments of these
parts is also to be observed. “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Minime prætereundum est, quod hic puer
virilis manstupratione gaudet, et semen ita eliminatum perfectum et bene eleboratum
se habet.</span></i>”</p>

<p class='c000'>This extraordinary subject is now (1822) fifteen years of age, but no
farther change has occurred in his habit; he is therefore like other
young men of his age, and attends very industriously to the trade of a
shoemaker, to which he is apprenticed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Gregory</span>, the late distinguished Professor of Edinburgh, used to
relate to his class, in order to convince them of the resemblance which
so generally exists between parents and children, that having been once
called to a distant part of Scotland, to visit a rich nobleman, he discovered
in the configuration of his nose, an exact resemblance to that of
the Grand Chancellor of Scotland, in the reign of <i>Charles the First</i>, as
represented in his portraits. On taking a walk through the village after
dinner, the Doctor recognised the same form of nose in several individuals
among the country people; and the nobleman’s steward, who accompanied
him, informed him that all the persons he had seen were descended
from the bastards of the Grand Chancellor.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f347'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r347'>347</a>. It cannot however be denied that most astonishing likenesses
sometimes exist between persons utterly unconnected by blood or
habit, of this we shall have occasion to speak more fully when treating
of personal Identity. The name of <i>Douglas</i> suggests a remarkable instance;
Mr. <i>Frank Douglas</i>, a well-known man of fashion, was committed
for highway robbery on the positive oath of one of the parties
plundered, and very narrowly escaped conviction. On the apprehension
of the notorious highwayman <i>Page</i>, the mystery was explained, the
personal resemblance being so great, as to deceive all ordinary observation.

<p class='c000'><a href='#r350'>350</a>. But it has been doubted whether the child may not be heard to
cry <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in utero</span></i>; Mr. <span class='sc'>Derham</span> (<span class='sc'>Phil. Trans.</span> vol. 26. p. 485) has given an
account of a case of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vagitus Uterinus</span></i>, in which the child is said to have
cried for near five weeks before delivery, and what is equally extraordinary,
the author professes to credit the story! <span class='sc'>Etmuller</span>, in his
Dissertation “<cite>De abstruso respirationis humanæ negotio</cite>,” c. 9. agrees with
<span class='sc'>Diemerbroeck</span> in considering such a phenomenon as impossible, and
attributes the noise to flatulence. The learned <span class='sc'>Verzascha</span> of Basil gives
a long catalogue of cases of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vagitus Uterinus</span></i>, in his third <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Observ. Medic.</span></i>
see also Dr. <span class='sc'>Needham’s</span> work “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De formato fœtu</span></i>.”—<span class='sc'>Christian II.</span> King
of Denmark, is said to have cried before he was born. We must, however
require very powerful testimony to shake our incredulity upon
this subject, and we should then be rather inclined to believe the event
with Livy, as a prodigy of Nature, than to consider it, with Derham,
as a natural phenomenon.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f351'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r351'>351</a>. The words <i>oyes ou vife</i>, do not warrant this doubt, (see Notes ibid),
for “the crying is but a proofe that the child was born alive, and so
is motion, stirring, and the like,” or indeed any other evidence to
shew that there was living issue born; such at least appears to be
the present law upon the subject, but it may be doubted whether the
ancient law did not contemplate not only a living child, but a child
born in due course, and therefore likely to live. A Fœtus of a few months
when extracted may move, yet such fœtus could not live, and cannot
be considered as possessing the principles of independent vitality; so
that it should survive its separation from the mother. But when a
child can cry, the lungs, which are to supply the circulation, for which
till then, the infant had been dependant, are matured for their office,
which once commenced the child becomes a separate and independent
being. <span class='sc'>Louis IX.</span> decreed, that in order to give a child the title of inheritance
it should have cried—i.e. completely respired.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f352'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r352'>352</a>. And query also, why was a living child required? Foreign writers
made a distinction between vivum and vitale, “Hoc est qui vitam protrahere
hæreditatis particeps fieri, eamque ad alios transferre possit.”
<cite>Ludwig. Ins. Med. For.</cite> p. 42.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f353'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r353'>353</a>. A cause in illustration of this subject was tried in 1806. <span class='sc'>Fish</span> <i>v.</i>
<span class='sc'>Palmer</span>—and was as follows: <i>Fish</i> had a still-born child by his wife,
and at her death, as no issue had been born alive, he resigned the estate
to his wife’s brother-in-law. He was, however, afterwards induced to
contest the fact of the child having been born dead. The accoucheur,
<i>Dr. Lyon</i>, had died before the trial, but it appeared in evidence, that
he had declared the child to be living an hour before the delivery, and
having directed a warm bath to be prepared, gave the child to the
nurse to be immersed in it. It neither cried, nor moved, nor did it
shew any signs of life; but two women swore, that while in the hot
water, there twice appeared a twitching and tremulous motion of the
lips: upon informing <i>Dr. Lyon</i> of this, he desired them to blow into its
throat, but it never exhibited any other signs of vitality. It was declared
by <i>Drs. Babington</i> and <i>Haighton</i>, that the muscular motion of the
lips could not have happened if the vital principle had been quite extinct,
and that, therefore, the child was born alive. <i>Dr. Denman</i>, however,
gave a contrary opinion, and declared that the child was not
born alive; and he attempted to establish an important distinction
between uterine and extra-uterine life, and considered that the
tremulous motion of the lips might arise from some remains of the former.
<i>Foderé</i> in quoting the case expresses a similar opinion, and pronounces
that the slight convulsive motions alluded to, ought not to have
been received as evidence of the child’s vitality. The Jury, however,
found that the child was born alive.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r355'>355</a>. If the wife be delivered of a monster, which hath not the shape of
mankinde, this is no issue in the law; but although the issue hath some
deformity in any part of his body, yet if he hath humane shape this
satisfieth. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hi qui contra formam humani generis converso more procreantur,
(ut si mulier monstrosum vel prodigiosum fuerit enixa inter)
liberos non computentur. Partus tamen cui natura aliquantulum ampliaverit

vel nisi quatuor habuerit, bene debet inter liberos commemorari. Si

extraordinary instances of monstrosity which are to be found in the periodical
collections published during the seventeenth and beginning of the
eighteenth century, as in the <i>Ephemerides, Journal des Sçavans, &amp;c.</i> In
one, there is mention made of a child born with a pig’s head; in another
a woman is delivered of an animal exactly like a pike fish!</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f358'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r358'>358</a>. The most remarkable case of this kind upon record is that related
by <span class='sc'>Buffon</span> (<cite>Hist. Naturells</cite>, Supplement, tom. ii, p. 410), of a double
infant, joined at the loins and having a common anus, but being in all
other respects, morally as well as physically, separate beings. They
were born at Tzoni, in Hungary, on the 16th of October 1701, and
died in a convent at St. Petersburg, on the 23d of February 1723. Their
names were <i>Hélène</i> and <i>Judith</i>; the one having been attacked with fever,
became lethargic and died, upon which the other was seized with convulsions
and survived her unhappy partner not more than three minutes.</p>

wide a range of readers, the authors have felt some difficulty in adjusting
their <em>Zero</em>; but when they assure their scientific friends that they
have heard a provincial attorney advocating the legality of smothering
a hydrophobic patient, they trust that they will stand excused, even
should their precautions be apparently trivial. Two women were tried
at the York Assizes in 1812, for drowning a child, which was born with
some mal-formation of the cranium, in consequence of which, it was
likely that it could not survive many hours. There did not appear to
have been any concealment on the part of the prisoners, who were not
aware of the illegality of the act.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r383'>383</a>. The only immunity to which pregnant women are entitled by
the law of England is the suspension of capital punishment until after
delivery. The state of utero-gestation appears in all ages to have
secured certain privileges and honours to the female; the Athenians
even spared the murderer who took refuge in her dwelling; the ancient
kings of Persia made presents of pieces of gold to every woman in this
condition; and even the Jews relaxed the rigid ordinations of the Mosaic
law, and allowed prohibited viands to the pregnant female, whose
delicate and fastidious appetite might make them objects of desire. In
Egypt the woman condemned to die, was never executed until after her
delivery, and the tribunal of the Areopagus observed a similar regulation,
that the innocent infant might not suffer for the crime of its mother.</p>

of legitimacy, it may often be important to determine the longest period
of utero-gestation, for the purpose of ascertaining a child’s right to property.
A child <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in ventre sa mere</span></i> is capable of taking by bequest or devise,
even from the earliest period after conception; in which point our civil
is more merciful, and more consonant to the course of nature, than our
criminal law, which regards only the time of quickening. If therefore
<i>A</i> bequeath or devise to all the children of <i>B</i> living at the time of his
death, and <i>B</i> six or seven months after his death is delivered of a child,
that child was clearly <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in esse</span></i> at the time of the testator’s death, and is
entitled to its share; it is equally clear at nine months, provided the
child be of its full growth; but after ten it may be made a question
whether such child is or is not entitled.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r451'>451</a>. Cases of such difficulty as to render the use of instruments absolutely
necessary are so rare as not to occur more than once in <em>six</em>, or, at
most, <em>five hundred</em> labours. <em>Midwifery</em>, as a practice, must have been
nearly coeval with the creation, but during the first ages it probably
consisted in little else than a knowledge of the method of dividing the
navel string; as difficulties, however, arose, this knowledge, of necessity,
was gradually extended to that of affording mechanical assistance in
the exclusion of the fœtus; but it would seem that for many ages those
artificial means consisted almost entirely in anointing the pudenda with
oil, and in placing the women in hot baths, as we learn from the writings
of <i>Hippocrates</i>, <i>Avicenna</i>, and other ancient writers, who appear to
have attributed the whole of the difficulty to a rigidity of the muscles,
and to have entirely overlooked that formidable obstacle to child-birth,
the mal-conformation of the pelvic basin. <i>Hippocrates</i> and <i>Celsus</i>, however
advise, that upon the failure of the ordinary means above alluded
to, the head of the child should be opened with a scalpel, and then extracted
with strong iron pincers or hooks; but it appears that the advice
of <i>Hippocrates</i> was rarely followed, and that, in such cases, the
child was mangled by the scalpel, and brought away piece-meal. See

the priesthood have enjoyed in deciding upon the propriety of performing
the <em>cæsarean section</em>; the doctors of the <i>Sorbonne</i>, and the heads of theological
schools and colleges have freely given decisions upon it, and
have ruled, that it ought to be performed whenever it is known that the
child is living, and it is impossible by other means to extract it alive;
for they assert that it is a deadly sin (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">péché mortel</span></i>) to perforate the head
of a living child in the womb. The clergy are instructed, in the event
of a mother refusing to submit to the operation, to omit no means of
persuading her; they are to point out all its advantages, and to intimate,
that the operation is not so cruelly painful as might be thought;
they are directed to speak of submission to it, as an act of the greatest
love to God, and resignation to his will, that can possibly be shewn:
it is even suggested, that under some circumstances, the patient might
be forcibly confined, and the operation performed against her will. It
is further declared, that physicians or surgeons refusing to recommend
or to perform the operation, when they should think it necessary, would
thereby render themselves guilty of a deadly sin, and ought to be reprimanded
by the magistrates; and praise is given to an edict, in force in
Sicily, which declares that no person shall be admitted to practise as a
surgeon, until he has been carefully examined as to the manner of performing
the <em>cæsarean</em> operation on the living mother. See <i>Merriman’s</i>

<p class='c000'>Amongst the different proposals which have been submitted to the
profession with a view to supersede the necessity of the Cæsarean section,
that proposed by <i>M. Sigault</i>, a surgeon at Paris, in the year 1768,
deserves some notice. The operation, which from the name of its inventor
was called the <i>Sigaultian</i>, consisted in making a section of the
<i>Symphysis Pubis</i>; perhaps, says <i>Dr. Merriman</i>, there never was a surgical
operation more enthusiastically received and commended than this. The
operator was immediately honoured with a pension from the French
government, and a medal was struck to commemorate the invention;
at length, however, the ill success of the practice occasioned it to sink
into complete desuetude, and the remembrance of it can now be beneficial
only as it may serve to caution us against the inconsiderate and hasty
adoption of modes of practice unsupported by just reasoning, and unsanctioned
by experience. <i>Merriman</i>, Op. citat. p. 168.</p>

Male and Female. The Greeks also called Hermaphrodites Ανδρογυνοὶ,

<div class='footnote' id='f472'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r472'>472</a>. In the <cite>Memoirs of the French Academy</cite>, there is an account of hermaphrodite
animals, that not only have both sexes, but do the office of
both at the same time; such are <em>earth-worms</em>; <em>round-tailed worms found in
the intestines of men and horses</em>; <em>land snails, and those of fresh waters</em>; <em>and all
the species of leeches</em>. And as all these are reptiles, and without bones,
<i>M. Poupart</i> concludes it probable, that all other insects which have
these two characters, are also hermaphrodites. Monstrous productions,
having a mixture of the male and female organs, and which have been
termed <i>hermaphrodites</i>, (although the <i>ovaria</i> and <i>testes</i> are always too imperfect
to perform their functions) appear to arise most frequently in
neat cattle, and are known by the name of <i>Free Martins</i>. The reader
will find much curious information upon this subject in a paper by <i>Mr.
John Hunter</i>, in the 69th vol. of the Philosophical Transactions. <i>Pliny</i> tells
us that the chariot of <i>Nero</i> was drawn by four hermaphrodite horses.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f473'>

first <i>Idiota</i>, which from his nativity, by a perpetual infirmity, is non
compos mentis; secondly, he that by sickness, grief, or other accident,
wholly loses his memory and understanding; thirdly, a lunatic that has
sometimes his understanding and sometimes not, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliquando gaudet lucis

mind only is not a sufficient reason for granting the custody of the person
and of his estate. The cupidity of relations is too apt to magnify
indiscretion, eccentricity, and more particularly pecuniary extravagance
into signs of madness; juries and commissioners cannot be too much on
their guard against such modes of proof, lest one half of the world
should lock up the other. The Romans committed prodigals to the
custody of a guardian, as if they had been infants or madmen; but this

<p class='c000'><a href='#r494'>494</a>. In common parlance it is called the jurisdiction of the Court of

is a branch of the king’s prerogative (17 <i>Ed.</i> 2. <i>c.</i> 9.) which is committed
to the Lord Chancellor, not by delivery of the great seal,
as his general jurisdiction is, but by warrant under the sign manual;
therefore the appeal is to the King in Council, and not to the House of
Lords; and neither the Master of the Rolls nor the Vice Chancellor
can sit for the Chancellor, or make any orders in matters of lunacy.</p>

8 <i>Ves.</i> 67; Lord <i>Eldon</i> said, “No one can look at this case without seeing,
that every person about this lady is satisfied, that some care
should be thrown round her. If clearly it is fit to protect her against
executing powers of attorney, that she should not decide where her
person, or with what trustees her property ought to be, all agreeing,
that she should not choose the persons who are to have the care of
her property, it is fit for me to put a controul upon those who may
be proper persons to have the controul of her property. I will not
subject her to another commission; but will direct two physicians,
who have not been concerned nor consulted, to talk to those who
have been concerned and consulted, to see the evidence, and afterwards
in the most tender manner, to find the means of visiting her
without alarming her, for the purpose of determining, whether her
state of mind is competent to the management of her affairs. I am
pretty confident Lord <i>Hardwicke</i> would not have gone so far: but
finding when I came here a course of cases establishing this authority,
and feeling a strong inclination to maintain it, or that the legislature
should take measures to preserve persons in a state of imbecility,
laying them as open to mischief as insanity; till these decisions are
reviewed, I will not alter them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>An order was made accordingly, restraining Miss <i>Kendrick</i> from executing

at greater length upon this subject, under the consideration of Criminal
Responsibility, in the third part of this work; upon the present occasion,
we shall only observe in the words of Dr. Haslam, that although the
usual effect of fermented liquors is temporary, yet that a single debauch
may produce a state of mind that may be continued into a permanent
insanity; and the person so affected may remain for many months in a
state of mental derangement, and during the prevalence of his disorder

<div class='footnote' id='f498'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r498'>498</a>. A lunatic ought not to be brought before the Court of Commissioners
under any artificial excitement. In a recent instance, a lunatic, or
supposed lunatic, was brought before commissioners for a second examination,
his conduct at the first having been rational; in the interval
he had been permitted to drink a considerable quantity of ale, spirits,
and bottled porter, immediately after which he was again produced,
when his altered demeanor convinced the jury (ignorant of his potations)
that he was lunatic, and a verdict was found accordingly. One
of the commissioners being afterwards accidentally informed of the circumstance,
laid the case before the Lord Chancellor, who immediately
quashed the commission. The conduct of these keepers could not be
too severely reprobated, and we may take this opportunity of hinting
that the practice of holding any judicial investigation in taverns and
public houses (where it can be avoided) is liable to many objections; at
least the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inquisitio post prandium</span></i> should be abolished.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r500'>500</a>. And when the lunatic’s estate is too small to bear the expense of
a commission, a reference has been directed to the Master, and an
order for the payment of dividends made on his report. This appeared
to Lord <i>Loughborough</i> to be irregular; the precedent was only to be
followed in cases of necessity. <i>Eyre v. Wake, Ves.</i> 179. In 1799 the
expense of a commission was about £120. Lord <i>Talbot</i> admitted a
defendant who had lost his memory by extreme age, to answer by

for the plea of lunacy, may recover, and claim his liberty, as was the
case of <i>Hadfield</i>, who shot at his late Majesty, and who presented a
petition for enlargement to the House of Commons. It is more than
doubtful whether such applications should ever be complied with; a
man restored to sanity under coercion may very quickly relapse when
he becomes his own master; a moderate quantity of spirits, or exposure
to other irritation, may readily produce a paroxysm which may be
attended with fatal consequences, either to the party himself, or, to some
other. Public policy therefore requires a continuance of the restraint,
however painful to the individual. If there be one case which admits
of relaxation less than another, it is where injuries of the head have
produced the insanity. For the trial of <i>Hadfield</i>, see 19 <i>How. St. Tri.</i>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r508'>508</a>. <span class='sc'>Delirium</span>, a word employed by the Romans, had its origin from the
process of ploughing; for when the oxen deviated from the line to be
pursued, they were said to be <i>de lira</i>, out of the track; and this figure
was transferred to the deviations of the human intellect, when it erred
from the established course. Delirium, says Dr. Cullen, may be shortly
defined,—“In a person awake, a false judgment arising from perceptions
of imagination, or from false recollection, and commonly producing disproportionate
emotions.” It is of two kinds; as it is combined with
pyrexia and comatose affections: or, as it is entirely without such combination;
in the latter case it is named <em>Insanity</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f509'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r509'>509</a>. There frequently exists an illusion as to particular things, to which,
says Dr. Male, men of genius are sometimes subject, which leads them
to indulge eccentric whimsies and extravagant fancies, whilst on every
other subject their perception is clear, and their conclusions correct;
instances of this kind abound in every treatise on insanity, and may be
traced from the earliest period of history. Pythagoras believed that he
had lived in prior ages, and inhabited different bodies, and that in
the shape of Euphorbus he had assisted in the siege of Troy. Tasso
fancied himself to be visited by a familiar spirit, with whom he conversed
aloud (<cite>Hoole’s Life of Tasso</cite>). The hero of the celebrated romance
of Cervantes, exhibits a well-drawn picture of this species of insanity;
and although in a less attractive costume, how frequently do we recognise
Don Quixote in every rank and description of society? If, says a
celebrated writer, the circle in which this absurdity revolves is so very
small as to touch nobody, a man is only what is then called <em>singular</em> in
that respect; but if its orbit is extended so as to run foul of other
people, he is then called a madman, and is confined.—<span class='sc'>Armata</span>, Part II.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r511'>511</a>. The case of Miss <i>Butterfield</i>, which we shall have other occasion to
refer to, is somewhat similar in effect to this. Mr. <i>Scawen</i> had left Miss
B. a considerable legacy; but being impressed by his surgeon with the
idea that she had poisoned him with corrosive sublimate, he turned her
out of his house and altered his will. Mr. S. died, and so evidently by
mercurial poison, that Miss B. was tried for the murder, but was acquitted,
there being no evidence that she was the person by whom the
poison had been administered, and a considerable probability that it
had been contained in some quack medicines which Mr. S. had taken.
Under such circumstances a restoration of her legacy might have been
expected either from the liberality of the next of kin, or from the interposition
of a Court of Equity.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r516'>516</a>. Public Lunatic Asylums may be considered as divisible into three

<p class='c000'>Most Eleemosynary Lunatic Asylums, either for want of sufficient
funds, or of room to accommodate all the lunatics who apply, exclude
epilepsy and idiotsy, making occasional exceptions, where the friends

<p class='c000'><a href='#r526'>526</a>. Religious fanaticism is so frequently attendant upon mania, that
a question has arisen respecting their relative dependance upon each
other, as to whether the former be the cause or the effect of the latter?
It seems probable that both these opinions are correct, for, as <i>Dr. Burrows</i>
very justly observes that, as religion influences the internal man
more than all the passions collectively, so it may be a <em>cause</em> of insanity;
while, on the other hand, there is no doubt, that a lunatic may imbibe
a religious as well as any other hallucination, and yet be insane from a
cause very contrary to religious.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f528'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r528'>528</a>. <i>Dr. Haslam</i> ventures an opinion upon this subject, which appears
to us so plausible that we shall introduce it to the notice of our readers.
“The ordinary class of persons, who are usually summoned to act as
jurymen, have in common with the mass of mankind, who have wanted
the means of direct information, adopted the popular and floating opinions
on the subject of insanity. That dramatic representations have
forcibly operated for this purpose there is little reason to doubt: and
some of the plays of <i>Shakspeare</i> exhibit many of the forms which this
malady is supposed to assume. Among such characters none have more
strongly fastened on the general mind than the outrageous <i>Lear</i>, and
the distracted <i>Ophelia</i>; the subtile crasiness of <i>Hamlet</i> leaves it doubtful
whether his alienation of mind be real or conventionally assumed, and to
the ordinary observer conveys more of fiction than the avowed counterfeit
of <i>Edgar</i>. Romances, the literary food of the idle and thoughtless,
abound in descriptions of intellectual calamity; but these artificers of
fancy, like many unskilful performers, are too prone to strain the loftier
impressions of feeling, and distort the energies of passion into mental
derangement. Something of affecting interest may be excited by the
weaknesses and wanderings of <i>Maria</i>, but <i>Cervantes</i> has exhibited the happiest
and most correct picture of systematic insanity; although the vehicle
of chivalry in which it is conveyed, has, to our own countrymen, blunted
its interest as a physiological portrait of madness; his sallies have provoked
mirth, and so keen is the relish for the ridiculous, that in the
luxury of laughter, the reader has forgotten the tribute of commiseration.”</p>

</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f543'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r543'>543</a>. On the manufactures and occupations above alluded to, we have
make the following observations.—</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) As the vegetable matter undergoes the putrefactive process in
stagnant pools, the effluvia which arise are necessarily highly pernicious;
while the waters become so poisonous as to destroy the fish contained
in them, as well as to prove injurious to cattle that drink of them. In
Italy the process of steeping flax or hemp is only permitted at the distance
of some leagues from a town. <span class='sc'>Zimmerman</span> tells us that the effluvia
from this source have been known to occasion a malignant fever,
which proved fatal to the family in which it first began, and afterwards
spread its contagion through a whole country. <span class='sc'>Lancisi</span> observes, that
dangerous fevers are often prevalent at Constantinople, which owe
their source to the hemp brought from Cairo, and which is put wet
into the public granaries, and suffered to ferment during the summer.
At Helmstedt there is annually in the autumn, when the flax is steeped
in the Aller, an epidemic dysentery that prevails for several weeks.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) The manufacture of starch can scarcely be considered, in itself,
a nuisance, for although it be necessary to produce the acetous fermentation,
in order to remove from the fecula any colouring matter, yet if
sufficient attention be paid to the operation, and the water be properly
let off from the settling-vessels, no inconvenience can arise. A nuisance,
however, of considerable magnitude may incidentally attend
these manufactories, from the number of swine which are constantly
kept by the starch maker, and the profit of which forms a part of his
speculation, and which is so considerable that he can generally afford to
sell the starch at prime cost, relying wholly upon the former trade for
his profits.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) The process of tanning involves several operations of a very nauseous
description; the hides, for example, undergo incipient putrefaction
in order to loosen the epidermis, and to render the hair and other
extraneous matter easy of separation from the true skin.</p>

<p class='c000'>(4) The peregrinations and vicissitudes of fate to which the horse is
doomed during life has repeatedly furnished subjects of reflection; but
few are aware to how many economical purposes his carcase is converted
after death, and to how many noisome processes it gives rise. The
dealers in dead horses, or <em>nackers</em>, as they are termed, begin their mercantile
anatomy by taking off the shoes and disposing of them to the farrier;
the skins are next stripped off, and sold to the tanner; the carcase is
then cut into pieces, and boiled in large cauldrons of water, in order to extract
the fatty matter, which, being skimmed off from the surface of the
liquor, is “<em>rendered down</em>” and packed in cases for the soap-boiler, or the
manufacturer of cart-grease. Whatever remains after this operation supplies
the venders of dog’s and cat’s meat with a dainty article of sale; at
length the views of the greedy trader are directed to the bones of this noble
animal; a number of persons find employment in chopping them into
small fragments, from which the marrow is then extracted by a boiling
for several hours, and added to the fat already obtained from the carcase;
the dry remains are employed in the production of hartshorn by distillation;
and after this process is finished, they are removed from the still, and
calcined to whiteness, in order to be mixed with clay for the manufacture
of porcelaine; or they are consumed for the formation of ivory-black.</p>

<p class='c000'>(5) The intolerable nuisance of a public brewery arises from the volumes
of carbonaceous matter with which it overwhelms the neighbourhood.
We shall therefore take this occasion to offer the remarks which
we are prepared to make respecting the effects of smoke on the inhabitants
of the <a id='metro'></a>metropolis, and on the methods which have been suggested
for the mitigation of the evil. And upon this subject we entirely agree
with an intelligent reviewer, that, after all, it is not a few chimneys
attached to steam engines that infect the air of London with smoke;
every house is busy in the work of contamination, although less observed,
because administered by separate vents, and in divided doses.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1661, a work was published by the celebrated <span class='sc'>John
Evelyn</span> on the subject of this grievance, entitled, “<span class='sc'>Fumifugium</span>; <i>or
the Inconveniences of the Air and Smoake of London dissipated; together with
some remedies humbly proposed to his sacred Majestie, and to the Parliament now
assembled</i>.” The above “short discourse” has become exceedingly scarce,
but the reader will find an interesting account of its contents in the
Journal of Science and the Arts. It is certainly a curious coincidence
that the attention of John Evelyn should have been first excited
on this subject by “a presumptuous smoake issuing from one or two
tunnels near Northumberland house, and not far from Scotland yard,”—the
very seat of the plots of our modern fumifugists! After adverting
to the situation of the metropolis “built upon a sweet and most agreeable
eminency of ground at the north side of a goodly and well conditioned
river, toward which it has an aspect by a gentle and easie declivity,”
he proceeds to animadvert upon that “hellish and dismall cloud
of sea coale, which is not only perpetually imminent over her head, but
so universally mixed with the otherwise wholesome and excellent air,
that her inhabitants breathe nothing but an impure thick mist, accompanied
with a fuliginous and filthy vapour, which renders them obnoxious
to a thousand inconveniences, corrupting their lungs, and disordering
the entire habit of their bodies.” It appears that in Evelyn’s time,
brewers, dyers, lime-burners, and salt and soap-boilers, were the principal
nuisances; and “since then,” says the editor of the new edition of
the <span class='sc'>Fumifugium</span> in 1772, “we have a great increase of glass-houses,
founderies, and sugar-bakers, to add to the black catalogue, at the
head of which must be placed the fire engines of the water-works at
London bridge and York-buildings, which leave the astonished spectator
at a loss to determine whether they do not tend to poison and destroy
more of the inhabitants by their smoke and stench than they supply
with water;” to which sooty list, says the reviewer, in the Journal of
Science and the Arts, above cited, “what astonishing additions have
been made, within the last thirty years, in and about London? How
many new water-companies, and smoke-producing manufactories have
been added to the catalogue? A newspaper cannot now be printed,
nor a pound of meat minced for sausages without a steam-engine; to the
same smoky servant the druggist resorts to grind his rhubarb and to sift
his magnesia,<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c011'><sup>[544]</sup></a> and upon all possible occasions the services of the
other elements is superseded by that of fire.” With respect to the deleterious
effects of smoke upon the health of the inhabitants of our
mighty city, much difference of opinion has existed; amongst Foreigners
the air of London has the reputation of being extremely unhealthy,
on account of the exhalation which arises from the use of coal; it excites
in strangers, says <i>Zimmerman</i>, a considerable heat in the stomach,
and sometimes a spitting of blood, and even nervous fevers which terminate
in palsy. (<cite>Experience in Physic, vol.</cite> 2, <i>p.</i> 137). It is hardly necessary
for us to make any observation upon a prejudice so absurd and
unfounded; <i>Evelyn</i> also seems, in our opinion, to attribute more evils to
the smoke than can be well substantiated; “I report myself,” says he,
“to all those who have been compelled to breathe the air of other countries
for some years, if they do not now perceive a manifest alteration in
their appetite, and clearness of their spirits, especially such as have
lived long in France and the city of Paris.” Although we are not disposed
to consider the smoky atmosphere of London as so destructive to
health as some have imagined, we are not prepared to state that it is
entirely harmless. Children are certainly less healthy in this city than
in the country; and the superior rapidity with which iron becomes oxidized,
indicates the existence of atmospheric impurities. The phenomena
of vegetation also offers another demonstration of the same fact;
Evelyn has the following curious remarks upon this circumstance: “That
the smoake destroys our vegetation is shewn by that which was by many
observed in the year 1644, when Newcastle was besieged, and blocked
up in our late wars, so as through the great dearth and scarcity of coals,
these fumous works were either left off, or diminished, divers gardens
and orchards planted even in the very heart of London, (as in particular,
my Lord Marquis of Hertford in the Strand; my Lord Bridgewater’s,
and some others about Barbican) were observed to bear such
plentiful and infinite quantities of fruits, as they never produced the
like before, or since, to their great astonishment; but it was by the
owners rightly imputed to the penury of coales, and the little smoake
which they took notice to infest them that yeare.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Although some difference of opinion may exist, as to the extent of the
evil, in a medical point of view, we must all concur in agreeing upon
the necessity of some plan by which it may be diminished; we shall,
therefore, proceed to offer some remarks upon the proposals which
have been made, at different times, for obtaining so desirable an object.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Evelyn’s</i> plan consisted in the removal of all smoking manufactories
from London, “five or six miles down the river Thames, or at
least, so far as to stand behind that promontory jutting out and securing
Greenwich from the pestilential air of Plumstead marshes.” He then
proposes gardens and plantations in and about the metropolis, and enumerates
a variety of fragrant plants, suited to our climate, and calculated
to sweeten and improve the air.<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c011'><sup>[545]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1682, Mr. <i>Justell</i> communicated to the Royal Society,
“<cite>An account of an Engine that consumes smoke, shewn lately at St. Germains
Fair in Paris.</cite>” <i>Dr. Leutmann</i>, of Wirtemburgh, described in his “Vulcanus
Famulans,” a stove which draws downwards, so that the contrivances
of the <i>Marquis de Chabannes</i>, and others who have burnt their
smoke by a downward draught of air were not original. <i>Dr. Franklin</i>
in 1785 (<i>Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Benjamin Franklin, vol.</i> iv. <i>p.</i>
408) suggested a mode of burning smoke; but to the illustrious <i>Mr.
Watt</i>, we are more particularly indebted for the first important hints
upon this subject; his patent may be seen in the <cite>fourth volume of the Repertory
of Arts</cite> for 1796, p. 226; and the great engines at the Soho manufactory
have all along been worked without smoke; it is therefore
not a little extraordinary, as a late reviewer has justly observed, that in
the Report from the Committee of the House of Commons “to enquire
how far it may be practicable to compel persons using steam engines
and furnaces in their different works to erect them in a manner less prejudicial
to public health and public comfort,” and upon which report
the bill of last session is founded, no notice is taken of <i>Mr. Watt’s</i> suggestions
and inquiries. In the Parliamentary Report, to which we have
just alluded, there are two inventions for the destruction of smoke,
which appear to have principally occupied the attention of the Committee,
and which profess to accomplish the object, with a very considerable
saving of fuel, viz:</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Mr. Brunton’s Fire Regulator.</i> In this patent a newly constructed
fire-place is applied to the engine boiler, containing a circular
grate, which is made to revolve slowly upon its axis; the fire
upon this grate is fed in front by a kind of hopper continually
delivering small coal, which, from the rotatory motion of the grate itself,
becomes equally spread upon its surface, so as to maintain a thin
fire, and a sharp draught; the coal is thus rapidly decomposed and
burned; the smoke at first produced having to pass across the grate,
and over the red hot, and already coaked fuel.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Patent of Messrs. Parkes of Warwick.</i>—The principal agent in this improvement
is a current of air, admitted just beyond the end of the fire-place,
by means of an aperture which may be increased, or closed at
pleasure, and which the patentee term an “<em>air valve</em>.” A small fire is
first made to burn brightly at the back of the grate; coals are then filled
in towards the front, in which direction the fire gradually spreads;
their smoke necessarily passes over the clear fire, where it becomes sufficiently
heated to constitute flame, as soon as it meets with the current
of air entering at the valve; and a striking experiment with this apparatus
consists in alternately shutting and opening the air-valve, which is
accompanied by the alternate appearance and disappearance of the
smoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instead, however, of insisting upon any form of fire-place, greater
benefit would arise from an enactment respecting the height of chimneys;
our intelligent reviewer, of whose remarks we have so frequently
availed ourselves, observes, that by conveying black smoke, and other
pernicious fumes into a capacious and very lofty chimney, much of the
noxious matters that otherwise escape into the atmosphere are decomposed
and precipitated or condensed within; of the truth of which, the
chimney of the grand-junction engine, at Paddington, and that of the
West Middlesex water-works, at Hammersmith, offer striking illustrations;
when these machines are at work, the former produces little
smoke, while the latter inundates the neighbouring gardens with perpetual
showers of solid soot; and yet the only difference is in the relative
altitude of the two chimneys; the boilers being, in all respects, set and
constructed alike. A chimney from 150 to 200 feet would in most
cases prove effectual, and the expense might be considerably lessened
by making one shaft receive all the tributary fumes of many flues. But
to return to the nuisance of breweries, from which we have made so
long a digression; it is probable, that the smoke from these chimneys
could not be remedied either by Brunton’s or Parkes’s patent, but the
increasing the altitude of the chimney would seem to promise a mode of
relief; we are also to look to the employment of steam as a substitute
for fires; high pressure steam has been very extensively employed for
this purpose in Whitbread’s brewery, and the smoke has in consequence
sustained a very perceptible diminution.</p>

<p class='c000'>(6) Sulphuric acid makers are continually indicted; and it would
appear that by a scientific improvement in the process, the escape of the
sulphurous acid, which constitutes the grievance, might to a great degree
be obviated. How does it happen that, notwithstanding the cost
of the materials necessary for the production of sulphuric acid, is in
France at least double what it is in England, the French can afford to
sell the article 25 per cent. cheaper than the English? the answer is obvious,—the
great part of the materials are sent off into the air, in the
form of <em>sulphurous acid</em>, and <em>nitrous gas</em>, to the annoyance of the neighbouring
animals and vegetables, and the ruin, too often, of the
proprietor. See <cite>Journal of Science and the Arts</cite>. In a report drawn
up in the year 1806 by Guyton Morveau, and Chaptal, upon the
subject of injurious manufactories, by command of the minister of
the interior, it is declared that the distillation of acids can only prove
dangerous from want of due precaution.</p>

<p class='c000'>(7) The manufacture of Prussian blue is necessarily attended with
highly offensive vapours. The first part of the process consists in mixing
hoofs and tup’s horns with Russian or American potass, in large
iron stills, to which heat is gradually applied, until the vessel become
red hot; the animal matter and alkali being thus fused into a mass is
laded out into iron pans, where it concretes into solid blocks, technically
called <em>metals</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>(8) The operation of unfolding the cow’s horns by the application of
heat is attended with a terrible stench; the trade in lanthorn leaves was
formerly very considerable with Russia; but it was nearly annihilated
by an edict of Catherine; the less flexible parts are made into combs;
and the tips of the horns are sent to Birmingham for the manufacture
of buttons.</p>

<p class='c000'>(9) Owing to the viscid nature of the materials, it is impossible to
make varnish without burning the animal matter, which occasions a
stench of the most insufferable kind; and is so suffocating, that very
lately two workmen lost their lives in a manufactory of this article in
Gray’s-inn-lane.</p>

<p class='c000'>(10) The animal matters employed in this process give rise to a stench
which has repeatedly formed the ground of indictment. The most
nauseous part of the trade, however, consists in concentrating the waste
lees, for the purpose of obtaining by fusion in a reverberatory furnace,
an article which is called <span class='fss'>BLACK ASH</span>, and which contains, amongst
other salts, the <em>sulphuret of soda</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>(11) “Renderers of tallow” are persons who convert the butcher’s

<p class='c000'>(12) The process of smelting different ores is the most injurious of all
the operations of art, although to the senses it may be less nauseous
than those in which animal matter undergoes decomposition by heat,
or putrefaction. These evils, however, by the ingenious application of
various mechanical and chemical expedients, have in many instances
been very materially diminished, and in others, entirely obviated; this
is strikingly illustrated in several large works for smelting lead ores; and
the proprietors of the Hafod copper works, at Swansea, are at present
engaged in an experimental inquiry into various plans which have been
proposed for diminishing, or preventing the ill effects which arise from
the metallic fumes. Acquainted as we are with the liberality and
science of these gentlemen, we have little doubt of the result; and we
mention the circumstance in this place in order to recommend similar
efforts on the part of persons engaged in other works; and at the same
time for the purpose of preparing the reader for some observations
which we shall take occasion to offer, on the subject of the law of nuisance,
in relation to its operation in stopping works of such national
importance. It would be premature to enter into any detailed account
of the chemical means which promise a successful resource on this occasion;
we shall only observe that the great mischief seems to arise from
the quantity of arsenic, so universally present in the ores of copper;
and there is reason to hope, from the experiments already made by Mr.
J. H. <i>Vivian</i>, that <i>Lime</i> may be usefully employed in preventing its
volatilization. The author of the present note has had ample opportunities
of investigating the effects of arsenical fumes, which arise from
the burning-houses in Cornwall, and from the great copper works carried
on at Hayle in that county, and they appear to be especially pernicious
to graminivorous quadrupeds; horses and cows lose their hoofs;
and the latter animals are not unfrequently seen, in the vicinity of the
works, crawling along on their knees; they are also subject to a cancerous
affection in their tails; and milch cows loose their milk. The herbage
also suffers materially from the poisonous smoke, especially in wet
seasons; corn is blighted in the ear, and never perfects its seed, unless
care be taken to select at that period such ore as will yield but little
sublimate. Cabbages do not appear to suffer in the least; nor are potatoes
materially injured; and it is not the least curious circumstance in
the history of these works, that the apple-trees in their vicinity grow
and bear fruit without sustaining any of those ill effects which we
should have anticipated, but, on the contrary, the arsenical fumes appear
to destroy all the insects which usually infest such trees, and their
trunks exhibit a cleanness which would delight the horticulturist. The
men employed in these works are occasionally affected with a cancerous
disease in the scrotum, similar to that which infests chimney-sweepers;
it is however probable that this arises from the immediate application
of the excoriating material made by the hand in the act of rubbing the
part. A similar affection was a short time since observed in a manufactory,
in which the workmen were engaged in making an arsenical
solution for a green dye, used in calico printing.</p>

<p class='c000'>(13) Gas Works. We have lately learnt, that a method has been adopted
to get rid of the nuisance which has arisen from the residual liquor from
these works, by evaporating it in pans, placed in the ash-pit of the furnace,
and by which the iron bars of the fire-place are at the same time
kept cool, and are therefore much longer preserved. The contrivance
may be seen at the gas works in Worship-street.</p>

of its amount:—The great pyramid of Egypt required for its erection

steam-engines in England, which are, at most, all managed by 36,000
men, would be sufficient to produce the same quantity of work, in 18
hours!!!</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r546'>546</a>. There are certain districts so devoted to manufactories that, in the
general assemblage, it would be extremely difficult to identify the
noisome effects of any particular one. A curious illustration of this
fact lately occurred in two indictments; the one preferred against
Apple, the proprietor of a prussian blue manufactory; the other
against Moore, black-ash manufacturer; both of whose works were
situated in Seward-street, Goswell-street. The counsel for the defendant,
in his cross-examination of the witnesses for the former prosecution,
artfully drew from them an account of the noisome vapours of the
black-ash maker; while in the latter trial, the same barrister made the
witnesses declare the extreme stench of the prussian blue manufactory;
so that in both cases the defendants obtained a verdict—because in
neither case could the evidence for the crown unequivocally prove from
which of the manufactories the nuisance complained of arose.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r547'>547</a>. But query, whether the ancient existence of an inconsiderable
brewery, which from the small quantity of fuel consumed, was not a
nuisance, should have warranted the augmentation of those immense
factories which now obscure and suffocate some of the most populous
districts in London.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f548'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r548'>548</a>. It is impossible to question the justice and policy of this maxim
as a general principle of legislation; “Salus Populi Suprema Lex,”—but
there are circumstances which ought to exempt certain establishments
from the operation of the common law of nuisances; we allude
to those grand national works for smelting ores, which could not be
closed without fatally affecting our national prosperity, and compromising
the fate of the Arts themselves. No consideration, however,
ought to admit them within the range of a great city, or a populous
district; but where they have acquired a kind of right to toleration by
time and necessity, in a remote place, they ought to continue in the
enjoyment of their advantages without disturbance; but in return for
such an immunity, the public has a right to expect every exertion on
the part of the proprietors, in order to obviate, as far as in them lies,
the diffusion of the fumes, throughout the neighbourhood, by improving
the construction of the furnaces, and by the adoption of such chemical
and mechanical expedients as may be capable of diminishing the evil.
We are led to these observations in consequence of learning with
regret that attempts have been frequently made to compel the proprietors
of the Hafod copper works, before alluded to, to abandon
them; and while the present sheet was in the press, we learnt that the
Grand Jury had found a true bill against one of these establishments.
We shall in consequence offer a few remarks, with a view of shewing
the necessity that exists of introducing a protecting clause into the law
of nuisances, in favour of certain established mining and smelting districts;
and we must here observe, that the inhabitants which congregate
in the vicinity of great manufactories of this description, are always,
in the first instance, allured to the spot, by the prospect of gain;
and it was not to be expected that persons who have been thus aggrandised,
should, as soon as their riches confer independence and fastidiousness
upon them, turn round and revile as insufferable and dangerous,
that very power to which alone they owe any personal consequence
to which they may now be entitled. But the strongest arguments
will be found in the great importance of these works in a national
and commercial point of view; and on this account we shall present
the reader with some statistical arguments of considerable weight, viz:
The quantity of coals consumed in the copper works in South Wales,
and exported in the vessels which convey the ore from Cornwall to
them, is calculated at 200,000 chaldrons annually; and the amount
paid for it to the collieries at from £100,000 to £110,000. The number
of persons employed in raising and delivering it is not less than
1,500. The number of persons employed in the smelting works is about
1,500, and the yearly amount of wages paid to them is not less than
£50,000. The value of the materials consumed annually in these works
may be taken at £20,000. The amount paid for the freight of ore and
materials may be stated at £25,000. The number of vessels employed
in the conveyance of the same may be about 150, and supposing them
to be manned by five seamen on the average, they give occupation to
750 mariners. Thus a sum of not less than two hundred thousand
pounds sterling is annually circulated in Glamorganshire and the adjoining
county, and employment given to 3750 individuals.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the families and dependants of these persons are taken into the
amount, a population of 12,000 souls at least derive their support from
the smelting establishments. The consequences which would result from
depriving so great a number of persons of the means of subsistence may
be more easily conceived than described. These estimates refer only to
the mere direct expenditure of the smelting works and their immediate
dependants—the consequences of the stoppage of these works to the
immense number of persons employed in the mines in Cornwall—between
50 and 60,000 souls—would be completely ruinous.</p>

<p class='c000'>These considerations it might be supposed are sufficiently apalling to
deter those who are engaged in the present measures carrying on against
one of the principal smelting companies by prosecution: an object
which is likely to be productive of consequences so destructive of the
welfare of thousands, in the annihilation of a trade of the utmost general
importance to the country, whether as relating to its internal or external
affairs, to its manufactories, its colonies, or its ships: a trade in
which upwards of two millions of pounds sterling are embarked. That
it ever should enter into the mind of any human being to prosecute
measures which could by any possibility lead to consequences so disastrous,
is almost inconceivable, and the only excuse that can possibly be
offered for them (if excuse it can be called) is, that they are so entirely
occupied by the consideration of their personal convenience and fancied
interest, as to be incapable of forming a just conception of the momentous
business they have undertaken.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r552'>552</a>. We are very sorry to instance the state of Covent Garden Market
as an exception to the rule of neatness and cleanliness, for which the
English have been celebrated; the quantity of putrescent vegetables allowed
to accumulate there is as disgraceful to the persons who have the
control of the market as it is disgusting to those who have occasion to
resort to, or even pass by it. <i>Dr. Rogers</i> relates that a very malignant
fever having appeared at Wadham college in Oxford, and carried off a
considerable number of people, and that the physicians ascribed it to the
putrefaction of a considerable heap of cabbages, which had been thrown
from the neighbouring gardens, on a spot of ground contiguous to the
college.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f553'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r553'>553</a>. Dr. Garthshore has observed that women, during the period of
utero-gestation, on account of the increased irritability of the system at
that period, are frequently affected by odours, that at any other time
would not have produced the slightest impression; and this experienced
practitioner was of opinion that the dangerous convulsions which sometimes
seize the patient towards the end of a tedious and difficult labour,
may arise from the long continued inspiration of the air of a close and
unventilated chamber crowded with attendants and friends.</p>

<p class='c000'>This observation suggests to us another circumstance which, though
it has never, we believe, been legally treated as a nuisance, well
deserves to be so considered; we allude to the public exposure of disgusting
objects for the purpose of exciting charity. The vagrant laws
are evidently ineffective for the purpose of removing them, nor
has the Society for the Suppression of Mendicity been much more successful;
those who have observed the pertinacity with which some
sturdy vagrants persecute pregnant females, obtruding on their view
some ulcerous sore, stump, or deformity, will agree in the necessity of
some more vigorous measures than have been yet employed for the abatement
of this species of nuisance.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f554'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r554'>554</a>. The Author well remembers being sent for on a professional visit
to the great copper works at Hayle, in Cornwall, and being told by a
man, who had been a smelter for more than half a century, that the
occupation was remarkably healthy, and that those who were engaged
in it escaped the ordinary maladies of the season and country; “The
smoke,” said he, “kills all disorders, especially Fevers.” This anecdote
is at least sufficient to shew the force of their prejudice.</p>
</div>

<div class='footnote' id='f555'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r555'>555</a>. The increase of the metropolis may be deemed a medical, though
it cannot be restrained as a legal nuisance; this has been long felt but
is still without remedy. In 1580 Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>, by proclamation,
prohibited new buildings within three miles of the city of London,
and commanded the Lord Mayor and officers to regulate the number
of inmates in each house, which had become excessive. 2 <i>Stowe’s</i> London,
436. About this time it was made matter of complaint that
“Moorfields, which formerly the citizens used for their health and
pleasure to walk in and take the air, began now to be enclosed, to
the hinderance of these healthful and useful walkings.” The limits of
a Sabbath-days journey will not afford the modern citizen a breathing
place; what effect this privation may have on the moral as well as physical
state of the poorer inhabitants of this overgrown capital we will
not attempt to discuss, and as the existing evil is without remedy, we
will content ourselves with a hope that some means may be found to
prevent its increase. An act of parliament limits the distance from
the new road within which no buildings may be erected; an extension
of this principle to all other roads five miles round London (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">exceptis excipiendis</span></i>)
and the imposition of double taxes on all houses to be erected
after a certain date, within a limited circuit, (with a decreasing ratio as
the radius increases) might possibly obviate the evil without very materially
interfering with the value of property. The capital is metaphorically
called the heart of the empire; we wish to provide it with sufficient
lungs that it may circulate more florid and healthy blood to the
extremities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since this note was written we have seen, in a collection of the statutes
passed in the time of the commonwealth, an act for the preventing
of the multiplicity of buildings in and about the suburbs of London and
within ten miles thereof, <i>An. Dom.</i> 1656, the preamble of which says,
“Whereas the great and excessive number of houses, edifices, outhouses,
and cottages, erected and new built in and about the suburbs
of the city of <i>London</i> and the part thereunto adjoining, is found to be
very mischievous and inconvenient, and a great annoyance and nuisance
to the commonwealth; and whereas, notwithstanding divers prohibitions
heretofore had and made to the contrary, yet the said growing
evil is of late so much multiplied and increased that there is a necessity
of taking some further and speedy course for the redress thereof;” certain
fines and penalties are therefore directed to be levied on all new
houses which have not <em>four acres</em> of land continually used with them, and
commissioners are appointed to carry the act into execution. The exceptions
in this statute may serve to elucidate the subject, Clare market,
Lincoln’s Inn Fields, Covent Garden, Shoe lane, and other places
now in the centre of the town are exempted from the penalties, on account
of the charges or covenants to which the owners had been or
might be liable.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r577'>577</a>. In this country, bread is chiefly divided into <em>white</em>, <em>wheaten</em>, and
<em>household</em>, differing only in degree of purity; in the first, all the bran is
separated; in the second, only the coarser; in the third, none at all;
so that <em>fine bread</em> is made only of flour; <em>wheaten bread</em> of flour with a mixture
of the finer bran; and <em>household</em>, of the whole substance of the grain,
without taking out either the coarse bran, or fine flour. <i>Stat.</i> 8 <i>Ann, c.</i>
18. In the statute of assize of bread and ale, to be hereafter noticed,
(51 <i>Hen.</i> 3,) mention is made of <em>wastel-bread</em>, <em>cocket-bread</em>, and <em>bread of treet</em>;
which answer to the three sorts of bread above mentioned, viz. <em>white</em>,
<em>wheaten</em>, and <em>household-bread</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bread of the London bakers maybe certainly considered as forming
a very distinct species, although by no means a definite one; there
are no less than six different kinds of flour brought into the London
market, which are designated by the following terms, viz. 1, <em>fine
flour</em>; 2, <em>seconds</em>; 3, <em>middlings</em>; 4, <em>fine middlings</em>; 5, <em>coarse middlings</em>; 6,
<em>twenty-penny flour</em>; besides which the London bread-flour is not unfrequently
deteriorated by having beans and peas ground up with it:
now it is a fact generally admitted that the very best wheaten flour can
alone produce beautifully white bread, unless some bleaching substance
be employed, in which case however inferior flour may be made into
bread equally specious to the eye; for such a purpose <em>alum</em> is universally
employed by the London bakers, and it has become a medical question
whether the health of the community is likely to be affected by the
practice. We should say that, generally, so small a proportion as ten
or fifteen grains of alum in a quartern loaf could hardly produce any
mischief, although we are inclined to think that certain constitutions
may be sensible to its influence, and that infants may occasionally suffer
from it; these effects are of course more likely to occur to persons who
only visit London occasionally, although upon this subject some important
fallacies may exist; and it is by no means satisfactorily established
that the costiveness, which is sometimes experienced by country residents
on their first coming to London, arises from the alum present in
the bread; for admitting even that it depends upon the bread, it may
be connected with the change in the relative coarseness of the flour
alone, for we have shewn in another work (<span class='sc'>Pharmacologia</span>, edit. 5,
page 160) that bran renders wheaten flour laxative from its mechanical
action upon the inner coats of the intestines. But a much more iniquitous
practice than that of adding alum to bread has been detected:
bakers have been convicted of using <em>gypsum</em>, <em>pipe-clay</em>, and <em>chalk</em>, and
not long since a very extensive fraud was carried on in Cornwall,
where a very considerable portion of the <em>Porcelain clay</em> (decomposed
felspar) from Saint Annes, was introduced into the bread; and the author
of this note was lately informed by Mr. Hume, of Long Acre, that on
examining some biscuits prepared for the use of the navy, he found
as much as eight per cent of <em>gypsum</em>. <i>Dr. Reines</i> observes that this adulteration
is very common in Germany, where the same mills are employed
to grind corn for the inhabitants, and gypsum for the purpose
of a mineral manure to the lands. It may be necessary to remark,
before quitting the subject of the adulteration of bread, that we
possess no summary and unexceptionable chemical test for the detection
of <em>alum</em>, since common salt, which necessarily enters into the composition
of the loaf, often contains saline impurities which may occasion
precipitates like those we might attribute to <em>alum</em>.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f578'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r578'>578</a>. This act of the 51st <i>Hen.</i> 3, stat. 6, (entitled a Statute of the Pillory
and Tumbril) is worthy of notice, as it is we believe the first in
which the adulteration of human food is specially noticed and prohibited.
It is thereby enacted that six lawful men shall collect the measures
and weights of the town, as well of taverns as other places, and
one loaf of every sort of bread. Afterwards twelve lawful men shall
swear to make true answer of the price of wheat, first, second, and
third, of barley, and oats; and of the price of bread, and for what default
a baker ought to be amerced or to be judged unto the pillory;
also if any steward or bailiff for any bribe doth release punishment of
the pillory and tumbril. Also if they have in the town a pillory of
convenient strength; next of the price of wine, and if any corrupted
wine be in the town, or such as is not wholesome for man’s body; also
of the assize of ale, and what brewers have sold contrary to the assize,
and ought to be judged to the tumbril; also if there be any that sell
by one measure, and buy by another. Also if any butcher do sell <a id='cont'></a>contagious
flesh, or that died of the murrain. Also of cooks that seethe
flesh or fish with bread or water, or any otherwise that is not wholesome
for man’s body, or after that they have kept it so long that it
loseth its natural wholesomeness, and then seethe it again and sell it.
Also of forestallers and regrators. The statute concludes by enacting
that when a quarter of barley is sold for two shillings, four quarts of
ale shall be sold for a penny; when for two and sixpence, the seven
quarts for twopence; when for three shillings, three quarts for a penny;
when for three shillings and sixpence, five quarts for twopence; when
for four shillings, two quarts for one penny, and so onward the prices
shall increase and decrease after the rate of sixpence.</p>

<em>beer-heading</em>, which is intended to impart the “<em>cauliflower head</em>,” and
consists of sulphate of iron, common salt, and alum, for which several
convictions have taken place, (<i>Minutes of the Committee, above cited</i>); it is
necessary to observe that the addition of this “<em>heading</em>” is made with a
view to restore the property of frothing to the porter, which has been
destroyed by dilution with table beer. The extract of the berries of
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coculus Indicus</span></i>, possessing properties eminently narcotic, is added
for a purpose too obvious to require explanation, and is regularly sold
by the brewer’s druggists under the technical appellation of “<span class='fss'>BLACK
EXTRACT</span>.” There is also another preparation, for a similar object,
sold under the name of “<span class='fss'>BITTERN</span>,” and which is a compound of <em>black
extract</em>, <em>extract of quassia</em>, <em>Spanish liquorice</em>, and calcined <em>sulphate of iron</em>.
“<span class='sc'>Multum</span>,” used as a substitute for malt and hops, consists of <em>Extract
of Quassia</em>, and <em>Liquorice</em>. We must close this note by expressing our
regret at the little assistance to be derived from chemistry in the detection
of such frauds; mineral substances, as <em>sulphate of iron</em>, or any of the
mineral <em>acids</em>, can certainly be recognised in our laboratories; but when
we attempt to identify vegetable principles, the resources of analysis
completely fail.</p>

of determining age from physiological criteria. Unfortunately the
ordinary mode of proof from parish registers is often defective, as the
act only requires the date of the baptism, and not of the birth; many
clergymen refuse to insert the latter under the plea that birth and baptism
should be nearly cotemporaneous. Every day’s experience shows
the contrary; and as many nice points may arise as to the very day on
which a person (for instance) attains the age of twenty-one, we hope
this practice will be amended.</p>

He was at the time of the bargain, and had been for ten years, afflicted
with Hemiplegia, in consequence of an apoplectic seizure; and he died
on the second day after the signing of the document. The question
therefore is, whether M. Frierd, on the day on which he signed the
papers, was, or was not, already under the influence of the disease to
which he fell a victim thirty hours afterwards. The question was debated
with much talent and ingenuity on both sides; and the volume

Journals of Florence for October 1776, by <i>M. Battaglia</i>, the surgeon,
who attended him; we extract a short account of this extraordinary
event from <i>Foderé</i> (tom. 8, p. 210) who to his own observations on the
subject adds those of <i>Fouquet</i>, <i>Marc</i>, <i>Koop</i>, and others. <i>Don Gio Maria
Bertholi</i> having spent the day in travelling about the country, arrived in
the evening at the house of his brother-in-law; he immediately requested
to be shewn to his destined apartment, where he had a handkerchief
placed between his shirt and shoulders, and being left alone, betook
himself to his devotions. A few minutes had scarcely elapsed
when an extraordinary noise was heard from the apartment, and the
cries of the unfortunate priest were particularly distinguished; the
people of the house hastily entering the room, found him extended on
the floor, and surrounded by a light flame which receded (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">â measure</span></i>)
as they approached, and finally vanished. On the following morning,
the patient was examined by <i>M. Battaglia</i> who found the integuments
of the right arm almost entirely detached and pendant from the flesh;
from the shoulders to the thighs the integuments were equally injured;
and on the right hand, the part most injured, mortification had already
commenced, which notwithstanding immediate sacrification rapidly
extended itself. The patient complained of burning thirst, and was horribly
convulsed, he passed by stool putrid and bilious matter, and was
exhausted by continual vomiting accompanied by fever and delirium.
On the fourth day, after two hours of comatose insensibility, he expired;
during the whole period of his suffering, it was impossible to trace any
symptomatic affection. A short time previous to his decease, <i>M. Battaglia</i>
observed, with astonishment, that putrefaction had made so much
progress that the body already exhaled an insufferable odour, worms
crawled from it on the bed, and the nails had become detached from
the left hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>The account given by the unhappy patient was, that he felt a stroke
like the blow of a cudgel on the right hand, and at the same time he saw
a lambent flame (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bluette de feu</span></i>) attach itself to his shirt, which was immediately
reduced to ashes, his wristbands (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poignets</span></i>) at the same time being
utterly untouched. The handkerchief, which as before mentioned, was
placed between his shoulders and his shirt, was entire, and free from any
trace of burning; his breeches were equally uninjured; but though not a
hair of his head was burnt, his coif (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">calotte</span></i>) was totally consumed. The
weather on the night of the accident was calm, the air very pure; no
empyreumatic or bituminous odour was perceived in the room, which
was also free from smoke; there was no vestige of fire, except that the
lamp, which had been full of oil, was found dry, and the wick reduced
to cinder.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>Maffei</i> (says <i>M. Battaglia</i>) would have found in the case of the Priest
<i>Bertholi</i> a confirmation of the opinion delivered by him (<cite>Journ. de med.
tome</cite> 68, p. 436) that lightning is sometimes excited in us, and destroys
us.</p>

<p class='c000'><i>M. Foderè</i> observes, that the inflamed hydrogen, occasionally observed
in church-yards, vanishes on the approach of the observer, like
the flame which consumed <i>P. Bertholi</i>; and as he, in common with
others, has remarked that this gas is developed in certain cases of disease,
even in the living body, he seems inclined to join <i>M. Marc</i> in attributing
this species of spontaneous combustion to the united action of
hydrogen and electricity in the first instance, favored by the accumulation
of animal oil and the impregnation of spirituous liquors.</p>

and felonious, but not the other. 1 <i>Hales P.C.</i> 485. (yet this homicide
may be excusable though not justifiable. See 1 <i>Hawk. P. C. c.</i> 28. <i>s.</i> 3.)
And there seems no doubt but the forcibly attempting a crime of a still
more detestable nature, may be equally resisted by the death of the unnatural
aggressor. For the one uniform principle that runs through
our own, and all other laws, seems to be this; that where a crime, in
itself capital, is endeavoured to be committed by force, it is lawful to
repel that force by the death of the party attempting. <i>Bl. Comm. c.</i> 14.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r611'>611</a>. This statute was passed in consequence of a Wager of Battle
offered by <i>Abraham Thornton</i>, appealed for the murder of <i>Mary Ashford</i>.
The decision of causes by combat was always absurd, and it was certainly
full time that it should be abolished; but it is not equally evident that
the appeal ought to have been taken away altogether, especially in
cases of murder. The preamble of the Act states the proceeding to
“have been found to be oppressive;” certainly it was also rare; in
above one hundred years there had been only one execution on appeal,
and when the case of the <i>Kennedies</i> (see <i>Bigby v. Kennedy</i>, 5 <i>Bur.</i> 2648)
is considered, it may fairly be doubted whether some constitutional
check ought not to have been retained against the misdirection of the
Royal prerogative. See also the case of <i>M‘Quirk</i> for the murder of

<p class='c000'><a href='#r612'>612</a>. The injuries thus occasioned, consist in rupture of the hymen,
swelling, contusion, inflammation, or laceration of the parts, discharge
of blood; and in persons of extreme youth, the laceration of the perineum
is said to have sometimes occurred; and as Rape cannot be
completed without considerable violence, we should also expect to
find marks of force in other parts of the body, such as bruises about
the arms and thighs; but in appreciating the value of such indications,
let the practitioner remember, that the greater part of them may occur
where the connexion has taken place with the consent of the female,
or they may even be the effect of disease. Dr. <i>Percival</i> relates a case
where the inflammation of the pudenda, and symptoms of defloration
occurred in a child four years old, which occasioned her death; there
were strong reasons for suspecting that she had been injured by a boy
of fourteen years of age, and he was accordingly taken into custody;
but the case received elucidation from several others of a similar nature
having been shortly afterwards received into the same hospital, and of
whose nature no doubt could be entertained. When Rape has been
committed, gonorrhœa, or lues venera are sometimes communicated,
especially in cases of young children, in consequence of a very general
opinion among the lower libertines of the male sex, that the best
possible cure for this disease, is intercourse with a virgin; if then the
accused should be found free from disease, where the female is contaminated,
and vice versa, it affords a strong presumption of his innocence;
in conducting, however, such an investigation, there are several
sources of fallacy, with which it is the duty of the medical enquirer
to be fully acquainted; he should know, that purulent discharges, from
other causes, do take place in children; and on the other hand that a
person, in whom no appearance of existing venereal infection can be
discovered, may communicate disease to others; this fact was ascertained
by Mr. <i>John Hunter</i>, and its truth has been satisfactorily confirmed
by the repeated observations of succeding surgeons. Women
labouring under leucorrhœa may impart a discharge to the male; and
Dr. <i>Male</i> observes, that the latter, affected by a gleety discharge in
consequence of strictures, and other irritations in the urethra, may
also affect the females.</p>

different nations; in the first ages of the Christian church so highly

infamous for a woman to die a maid. In Peru and several other
provinces in South America, we are assured by <i>Pedro de Cieca</i>, in
the history of the Incas, &amp;c. that men never marry, but on condition
that the next relation or friend of the maid shall undertake

Mais pour admettre un pareil signe, il faudroit qu’il existât
naturellement chez toutes les vierges sans exception, et qu’il ne se

qu’il ne pût être détruit ou effacé que par la copulation. D’abord la

chez des femmes enceintes, et pres d’être meres!! Gavard rapporte
l’example d’une fille de treize ans qui avait gagné la maladie vénérienne
dans un lieu public, et qui neanmoins conservait encore cette
marque de virginité. Severin Pineau assure aussi que deux jeunes
personnes reçurent, dans le temps des règles, les embrassemens d’un
homme sans éprouver la moindre dechirure de l’hymen. On conçoit
en effet avec <i>Teichmeier</i> et <i>Brendel</i> que celà est très possible dans le
temps de la menstruation; car alors l’orifice du vagin devenant plus
souple et plus large qu’à l’ordinaire, peut admettre plus facilement
le membre de l’homme qui peut être aussi fort petit: ajoutons à cela
que l’hymen, surtout quand il est de forme semi-lunaire, humecté et
remolli par l’ecoulement du sang menstruel, peut offrir moins de resistance,
ceder et s’appliquer à la surface interne du vagin, et permettre
la copulation sans se rompre. <i>Mauriceau</i> a cité plusieurs femmes
enceintes dont l’hymen etait dans son intégrité. <i>Ruisch</i> parle
d’une femme dont la delivrance était empêchée, non-seulement par
l’hymen, mais encore par une autre membrane non naturelle. On

brusquement par la tête de l’infant. Nous avons vu nous-même, la

<div class='footnote' id='f623'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r623'>623</a>. In entering upon a disquisition on the tests of virginity, it is hardly
necessary to enumerate the many absurd marks related by the more
credulous, as indicative of recent defloration, such as, swelling of the
neck, rings around the eyes, the colour of the skin and urine, &amp;c.
nor is it necessary to enter into a refutation of the story, credited by
<i>Mahon</i>, of a monk at Prague who could tell a maid by the smell. We
shall therefore proceed at once to consider the value of that test which
most commonly passes among us as the least equivocal mark of virginity,
viz. the presence of a peculiar membrane termed the <i>Hymen</i>.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>The Hymen</span> (so named from the Greek word ὑμην, a membrane)
is formed by four angular duplicatures of the membrane of the vagina,
the union of which may be discovered by corresponding lines on the
hymen. At the upper part there is a semilunar vacancy, intended for
the transmission of the menses, so that it assumes the form of a crescent:
a circumstance which affords the true explanation of the origin
and meaning of the symbol so characteristically assigned to <i>Diana</i>.
(See <i>J. G. F. Tolbeng, de varietate hymenum. Hal.</i> 1791, 4to.) In some
rare cases, the hymen is an imperforate circular membrane, attached to
the edge of the orifice of the vagina in every part, so as to close the
canal completely, (we have already noticed this fact under the subject
of Impotence, p. <a href='#Page_207'>207</a>). The girls, in whom this fault of conformation
existed, were called by the Greeks ἁτρηταὶ; physicians who have
written in Latin amongst us, have given them the name of <i>Imperforatæ</i>,
<i>clausæ</i>, or <i>velatæ</i>; and the Italians that of <i>Coperchiate</i>. The Romans had no
appropriate word to denote this malformation, and they were therefore
obliged to express it by some circumlocution; it is thus that <span class='sc'>Cicero</span>
(<cite>De Divinat: Lib.</cite> II.) speaks of a dream, where a woman was seen,
“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quæ obsignatam habebat nuturam</span></i>;” and that <span class='sc'>Pliny</span> (<cite>Hist. Nat. Lib.</cite> VII.
<i>c.</i> 16) relates, <i>Cornelius</i>, the mother of the <i>Gracchi</i>, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">concreta genitali nata
fuerat</span></i>.” In many cases the membrane appears never to have been
formed; while in others, its extreme tenacity has occasioned its rupture
and destruction in early life; it may, moreover, have been destroyed
by disease, by noxious habits, or by acrimonious discharges.
This extreme uncertainty has led many authors, of no inconsiderable
eminence, to deny its existence, while others have acknowledged its
occasional presence, but have attributed its formation to disease.
<span class='sc'>Graaf</span>, <span class='sc'>Penius</span>, <span class='sc'>Buffon</span>, <span class='sc'>Dionis</span>, declare that, by dissection of girls
of all ages, they have never been able to discover it; on the other

<span class='sc'>Winslow</span> (<cite>Exposit. Anatom. No.</cite> 653), all describe this membrane, and
assert that they have found it in every young girl they have had occasion
to examine. <i>Astruc</i> (<cite>On the diseases of Women, vol.</cite> 1. <i>p.</i> 123), in referring
to the above learned authorities, observes that, “the inference
must necessarily be, that those who deny ever to have seen it, must
either have examined only such girls as had lost their virginity; or,
prepossessed with the false notion that the <em>hymen</em> must always close the
entrance to the <em>vagina</em> entirely, they have mistaken it at the time it was
before their eyes, and have even sometimes given the description of it,
without mentioning the name.” After this literary history of the
question, we may very safely conclude, that the <em>Hymen</em> is a perfectly
natural structure, occurring in the virgin, and that by sexual intercourse
it is ruptured; after which it is shrivelled into several small
excrescences at the orifice of the urethra, called the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carunculæ Myrtiformes</span></i>.
But since it is liable to such variations in appearance, and to
accidental rupture from the slightest causes, its absence can never be
received as evidence of defloration; nor can its presence be considered
as an unequivocal proof of virginity; for it has been asserted by indisputable
authority, that it is not always ruptured <i>in Coitú</i>. <span class='sc'>Ruysch</span> has
said, that if the coitus take place immediately after the menstrual excretion,
this membrane is often not ruptured, (<cite>Observ. Anat. Chirurg.</cite> xxii).
And we have already alluded to cases, wherein the Hymen was actually
entire at the time of delivery. (See p. <a href='#Page_203'>203</a>, and <a href='#f304'>note</a>.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Some authors have talked of the renewal of the hymen after its rupture;
this we apprehend can never happen, although a spurious reparation
of certain local consequences, incident to the loss of virginity,
may certainly occur from the effects of adhesive inflammation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having thus disposed of the subject of Hymen, we next come to
consider the state of the Vagina, as an indication of Virginity, upon
which some authors have attached considerable weight, especially the
Italian medico-jurist <span class='sc'>Tortosa</span>. In a healthy virgin it ought certainly
to be rigid and narrow, since the only function which it has to perform
is that of giving transit to the menstrual flux: the parts may
however become dilated, and their natural rugæ be obliterated from
various innocent causes. Certain mal-practices will likewise occasion
the same relaxation as sexual intercourse. Some authors have considered
a rigidity of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">frenum labiorum</span></i>, at the inferior, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">posterior commissure</span></i>
of the <i>pudenda</i>, as a proof, if not of virginity, of a rare indulgence
in sexual intercourse. The Mosaic test of Virginity, the effusion
of blood, however conclusive it might have been among the Jews,
certainly cannot be received as unexceptionable in these Northern
climates. The Jews, it would seem, placed so much reliance upon appearances,
that the nuptial sheets were constantly viewed by the
relations on both sides; and the maid’s parents preserved them as a
token of her virginity, to be produced in case her husband should ever
reproach her upon that subject. In case the token of virginity was
not found on them, she was to be stoned to death at her father’s door.
This evidence is still required by some of the tribes inhabiting the
banks of the Indus.—<cite>Pottinger’s Travels, p.</cite> 70. In some cases the effusion
of blood during the first act of coition, is very considerable, and
is liable to be confounded with the <i>Catamenia</i>; we have however already
observed (p. <a href='#Page_187'>187</a>, <a href='#f273'>note</a>) that the menstrual excretion does not, in its
natural state coagulate; and yet this assertion requires some qualification;
for it is well known, that when the discharge is superabundant
and attended with great pain, it often comes away in coagula, in which
case there is probably an admixture of common blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>From what has been here related, we are bound to conclude, that
there does not exist any anatomical sign, by which the virginity of a
female can be unequivocally determined. By midwives and matrons
however, the subject has been treated with less diffidence; in the statutes
of the sworn matrons, or midwives of Paris, containing likewise
divers formulæ of reports, and depositions made in court, upon their
being called to visit girls that made their complaint of being deflowered,
they laid down fourteen marks on which to form a judgment. <i>Laur.
Joubart</i>, a celebrated physician of Montpellier, has transcribed three of
these reports—one made to the Provost of Paris, another in Languedoc,
and a third in Berne.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears from the experiments and observations of our most accurate
physiologists, that the fluid expelled in copulation is furnished in
a small proportion only by the Testes; that to this a peculiar secretion
of the Vesiculæ Seminales is added, and that the chief bulk is made up
of the Prostatic liquor, or secretion from the prostate gland; so that
the fact of emission in Eunuchs is not extraordinary, although the discharged
fluid cannot be said to be <em>Seminal</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r633'>633</a>. This belongs to a class of cases of which we shall take no other

<div class='footnote' id='f634'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r634'>634</a>. In the celebrated case of <i>Mary Ashford</i>, the prisoner <i>Abraham
Thornton</i>, admitted the carnal knowledge, adding that it was with her
own consent, but the whole of the evidence repelled the latter assertion;
the death of his unhappy victim (however caused) rendered it impossible
to convict him of Rape.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r635'>635</a>. It is possible that a woman who has consented to her dishonor by
one person, may on fear of discovery, or for some malignant motive,
charge the crime on another; or as in the cases mentioned by <i>Capuron</i>,
she may have produced external appearances of injury for the same
nefarious purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'><a href='#r636'>636</a>. <i>Farr</i> and <i>Faselius</i> incline to the same opinion. The Parliament of
Thoulouse passed a decree upon this subject, deciding that a woman
violated might nevertheless conceive; the physicians having on that
occasion reported, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">posse quidem voluntatem cogi, sed non naturam,

<div class='footnote' id='f640'>
<p class='c000'><a href='#r640'>640</a>. It is somewhat singular that several eminent writers should have

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
